(a)

by publishing it on the websites of both the Regulator and the Institution in Resolution;

(b)

by publishing it on any national or international newspaper available for general sale in the UAE or other publication which in the opinion of the Regulator would maximise the likelihood of the Resolution Order coming to the attention of affected persons; and
