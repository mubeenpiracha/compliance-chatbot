is in a situation of stress so as to address or remove the causes of the distress and restore the financial position of the Group or the Institution in question, at the same time taking into account the financial position of other Group Entities. The Group Recovery Plan shall include the information set out in Part 1 of the Schedule (with any necessary modifications for the Group level). The Regulator may require that additional information be included in the Group Recovery Plan.

The Management of the ADGM Parent Institution shall assess and approve the Group Recovery Plan before submitting it to the Regulator.

Unless directed otherwise by the Regulator, ADGM Parent Institutions required to prepare a Group Recovery Plan under subsection (1) shall update their Group Recovery Plans annually and after any change to the Group's legal or organisational structure, business or financial situation, which could have a material effect on, or necessitate a change to, the Group Recovery Plan.

Assessment of Recovery Plans

The Regulator shall examine Recovery Plans submitted to it with a view to identifying any elements in the Recovery Plan which may adversely impact the resolvability or supervision of the Institution or Group.

In assessing a Recovery Plan, the Regulator may consider—

(a)

whether the arrangements proposed in the Recovery Plan would, if implemented, be reasonably likely to maintain or restore the viability and financial position of the Institution;

(b)

whether the arrangements proposed in the Recovery Plan would be reasonably likely to be implemented quickly and effectively in situations of financial stress and, as far as possible, without any material adverse impact on the financial system of the ADGM;

(c)

any preparatory measures taken or planned to be taken by the Institution;

(d)

the possibility that the Recovery Plan may have to be implemented at the same time as Recovery Plans prepared by other Institutions; and

(e)

whether the capital and funding structure of the Institution is appropriate, having regard to the level of complexity of its organisational structure and its risk profile.

In assessing a Group Recovery Plan, the Regulator may consider the potential impact of the recovery measures on financial stability in all the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. In doing so, the Regulator may consult the supervisory authorities and resolution authorities of the jurisdictions in which any Group Entities or Branches are located.

If the Regulator determines that there are material deficiencies in a Recovery Plan, or material impediments to its implementation, it shall notify the relevant Institution of its assessment in writing and require the Institution to submit, within two months, extendable with the Regulator's approval by one month, a revised Recovery Plan demonstrating how those deficiencies or impediments have been addressed.

If the Institution fails to submit a revised Recovery Plan within the specified timeframe, or the Regulator determines that a matter notified under subsection (4) has not been adequately addressed in the revised Recovery Plan, the Regulator may direct the Institution to take any measures it considers to be necessary and proportionate. Such directions may include, without limitation, directing the Institution to—

(a)

reduce the risk profile of the Institution or Group, including liquidity risk;

(b)

require it or its Group to undertake timely recapitalisation;

(c)

review its or its Group's strategy and structure;

(d)

change its or its Group's funding strategy in order to improve the resilience of Core Business Lines and Critical Functions; and

(e)

change its or its Group's governance or Subsidiary structure.

Chapter 2 Resolution Plans

Individual Resolution Plans

The Regulator may require an Institution to prepare and submit to it an Individual Resolution Plan for the Institution. In exercising this discretion, the Regulator will consider the risk profile of the Institution and the impact of its failure on the financial system, market confidence or the economy in the ADGM or the reputation, integrity or public confidence in the stability of the ADGM.

An Individual Resolution Plan shall—

(a)

be proportionate to the systemic importance of the Institution;

(b)

set out the options for applying a Resolution Tool and a Resolution Power to the Institution;

(c)

take into consideration relevant scenarios including that the event of a failure of the Institution may be unusual, occur at a time of broader financial instability or system- wide events;
