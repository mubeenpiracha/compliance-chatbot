Recovery and Resolution Planning

Chapter 1 Recovery Plans

Individual Recovery Plans

The Regulator may require an Institution to prepare and submit to the Regulator for review an Individual Recovery Plan for the Institution. In exercising this discretion, the Regulator will consider the risk profile of the Institution and the impact of its failure on the financial system, market confidence or the economy in the ADGM or the reputation, integrity or public confidence in the stability of the ADGM.

The Individual Recovery Plan shall include the information set out in Part 1 of the Schedule and shall set out measures that would be taken by the Institution for the restoration of its financial position in the event of a significant deterioration of such financial position. The Regulator may require that additional information be included in the Individual Recovery Plan.

The Management of the Institution shall assess and approve the Individual Recovery Plan before submitting it to the Regulator.

For Institutions forming part of a Group headed by a Non-ADGM Financial Institution, the Regulator may require disclosure of part or all of any existing Recovery Plans prepared at the Group level at the request of the supervisory authorities in jurisdictions other than the ADGM of any Group Entities. The Regulator may determine that such a disclosure satisfies the requirements under subsection (1).

Unless directed otherwise by the Regulator, Institutions required to prepare an Individual Recovery Plan under subsection (1) shall update their Individual Recovery Plans annually and after any change to their legal or organisational structure, business or financial situation, which could have a material effect on, or necessitate a change to, the Individual Recovery Plan.

Group Recovery Plans

The Regulator may require an ADGM Parent Institution to prepare and submit to the Regulator a Group Recovery Plan for the Group headed by the ADGM Parent Institution as a whole.

The Group Recovery Plan shall identify measures that may be required to be implemented at the level of the ADGM Parent Institution, the Institutions and other Subsidiaries, with the aim to achieve the stabilisation of the Group as a whole, or any Institution of the Group, when it
