Ancillary provisions relating to bail-in

Where the Regulator exercises the Write Down or Conversion Power, such write down or conversion shall take effect and be immediately binding on the Institution in Resolution and Affected Creditors and Shareholders of the Institution in Resolution.

The Regulator may complete or cause the completion of all administrative and procedural tasks necessary to give effect to the Write Down or Conversion Power including—

(a)

the amendment of all relevant registers;

(b)

the delisting or removal from trading of Shares or Debt Instruments;

(c)

the listing or admission to trading of new Shares; and

(d)

the relisting or readmission of any Debt Instruments which have been written down, without the requirement for a Prospectus if a Prospectus would in normal circumstances be required.

Where the Regulator reduces to zero the principal amount of, or outstanding amount payable in respect of, a liability by means of the Write Down or Conversion Power, that liability and any obligations, rights or claims arising in relation to it that are not accrued at the time when the power is exercised shall be discharged for all purposes, and shall not be provable in any subsequent proceedings in relation to the Institution in Resolution or any successor entity in any subsequent Winding Up.

Where the Regulator reduces in part, but not in full, the principal amount of, or outstanding amount payable in respect of, a liability by means of the Write Down or Conversion Power—

(a)

such liability, and the counterparty's corresponding claim, shall be discharged to the extent of the amount reduced; and

(b)

the relevant instrument or agreement that created the original liability shall continue to apply in relation to the residual principal amount of, or outstanding amount payable in respect of the liability, subject to any modification of the amount of interest payable to reflect the reduction of the principal amount, and any further modification of the terms that the Regulator might make by means of the Write Down or Conversion Power or the power under section 58(1)(p).

Procedural impediments to the conversion of Eligible Liabilities to Shares by virtue of their instruments of incorporation or of any other law of the ADGM, including pre-emption rights for Shareholders or requirements for the consent of Shareholders to an increase in capital, shall not prevent the application of a Resolution Tool or exercise of a Resolution Power.

Contractual recognition of bail-in

Subject to subsection (2), the Regulator may require an Institution to include in its contractual documents a contractual term by which the creditor or party to an agreement creating an Eligible Liability recognises that that liability may be subject to the Write Down or Conversion Power and agrees to be bound by any reduction of the principal or outstanding amount due, conversion or cancellation that is effected by the exercise of that power by the Regulator, provided that such liability is—

(a)

not excluded under section 49(7);

(b)

governed by the law of another jurisdiction; and
