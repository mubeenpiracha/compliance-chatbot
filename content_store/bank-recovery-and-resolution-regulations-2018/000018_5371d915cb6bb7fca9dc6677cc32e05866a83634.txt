(b)

a period of seven days, beginning from the date on which the notification required under subsection (1) was made, has expired, in which event the Regulator shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance of Insolvency Proceedings.

Without prejudice to any restriction on the enforcement of security interests imposed pursuant to section 61, if necessary for the effective application of the Resolution Tools and Resolution Powers, the Regulator may request the Court to apply a stay for an appropriate period of time in accordance with the objective pursued, of any judicial action or proceeding in which an In-Scope Entity under Resolution is or becomes a party.

Creditor hierarchy

For the purposes of Resolution of In-Scope Entities, the following shall have the same priority ranking which is higher than the ranking provided for the claims of ordinary unsecured, non- preferential creditors—

(a)

an Eligible Deposit; and

(b)

a Deposit that would be an Eligible Deposit if it were made in the ADGM.

In respect of In-Scope Entities, the priority ranking set out in subsection (1) on In-Scope Entities shall override any relevant conflicting provisions set out in the Insolvency Regulations 2015.

Assessment by the Regulator

Where there is a requirement to notify or obtain approval of the Regulator of an acquisition of, or increase in the level of, control under Part 10 of the Financial Services and Markets Regulations 2015 by virtue of the taking of Resolution Action that would result in a change in the level of ownership of a person by another person, the Regulator shall carry out a relevant

(2)

assessment related to that notification in a timely manner that does not delay or prevent the taking of the Resolution Action.

Where the Regulator has not completed an assessment required under subsection (1) or given any relevant approval of a transfer or conversion by the date that the Resolution Action is made effective by the Regulator, the following shall apply—

(a)

such a transfer or conversion shall have immediate legal effect;

(b)

during the assessment period and during any divestment period, an acquirer's voting rights attached to such Shares shall be suspended and vested solely in the Regulator, which shall have no obligation to exercise any such voting rights and which shall have no liability whatsoever for exercising or refraining from exercising any such voting rights;

(c)

during the assessment period and during any divestment period, neither the penalties nor other measures for failing to comply with the requirements for acquisitions or disposals of qualifying or significant shareholdings under Part 10 of the Financial Services and Markets Regulations 2015 and any subordinate legislation under the Financial Services and Markets Regulations 2015 shall apply to such a transfer or conversion;

(d)

promptly upon completion of the assessment by the Regulator, the Regulator shall notify the acquirer in writing of whether the Regulator approves or, on the grounds referred to in the Financial Services and Markets Regulations 2015 or any subordinate legislation under the Financial Services and Markets Regulations 2015, opposes such a transfer of Shares to the acquirer or the acquisition of Shares by the acquirer as a result of conversion;

(e)

if the Regulator approves such a transfer of Shares to the acquirer (or the acquisition of Shares by the acquirer as a result of conversion), then the voting rights attached to such Shares shall be deemed to be fully vested in the acquirer immediately upon receipt by the acquirer of such approval notice from the Regulator; and

(f)

if the Regulator opposes such a transfer of Shares to the acquirer (or the acquisition of Shares by the acquirer as a result of conversion), then—

(i)

the voting rights attached to such Shares as provided by subsection (b) shall remain in full force and effect;

(ii)

the Regulator may require the acquirer to divest such Shares within a divestment period determined by the Regulator having taken into account prevailing market conditions; and

(iii)

if the acquirer does not complete such divestment within the divestment period established by the Regulator, then the Regulator may impose on the purchaser penalties and other measures for failing to comply with the requirements for acquisitions or disposals of qualifying or significant shareholdings under Part 10 of the Financial Services and Markets Regulations 2015 or any subordinate legislation under the Financial Services and Markets Regulation
