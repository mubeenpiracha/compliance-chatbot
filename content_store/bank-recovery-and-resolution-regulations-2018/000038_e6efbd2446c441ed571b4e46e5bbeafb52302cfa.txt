 to cancel such Shares; and

Chapter 5 Resolution Safeguards

67.

Treatment of Shareholders in the case of partial transfers and application of the bail in tool

Where one or more of the Resolution Tools have been applied, the Regulator shall be guided by the following principles—

(a)

except where subsection (b) applies, where the Regulator transfers only part of the rights, assets and liabilities of the Institution in Resolution, the Shareholders and creditors whose claims have not been transferred should, to the extent reasonably practicable, receive in satisfaction of their claims at least as much as they would have received if the Institution in Resolution had been Wound Up under Insolvency Proceedings at the time (when the Regulator delivered notice in accordance with section 24(3)); and

(b)

where the Regulator applies the Bail-in Tool, the Shareholders and creditors whose claims have been written down or converted to Shares should, to the extent reasonably practicable, not incur greater losses than they would have incurred if the Institution in Resolution had been Wound Up under Insolvency Proceedings immediately at the time (when the Regulator delivered notice in accordance with section 24(3)).

68.

Difference of Treatment Valuation

(1)

For the purpose of assessing whether Shareholders and creditors would have received better treatment if an Institution in Resolution had been Wound Up under Insolvency Proceedings, the Regulator shall, in accordance with any eligibility criteria prescribed under section 40, appoint an independent valuer to carry out a valuation as soon as practicable after the application of a Resolution Action.

(2)

A Difference of Treatment Valuation shall be distinct from any Pre-Resolution Valuation, Provisional Valuation or Definitive Valuation.

(3)

A Difference of Treatment Valuation shall determine—

(a)

the treatment that Shareholders, creditors and Depositors would have received if Insolvency Proceedings in respect of the Institution in Resolution had commenced at the time when the decision was made to take Resolution Action;

(b)

the actual treatment that Shareholders, creditors and Depositors have received; and

(c)

if there is any difference between the treatment referred to in subsections (a) and (b).

(4)

A Difference of Treatment Valuation shall—

(a)

assume that Insolvency Proceedings in respect of the Institution in Resolution would have commenced on the date on which the Regulator delivered notice in accordance with section 24(3);

(b)

assume that the Institution in Resolution would, if it had entered Insolvency Proceedings in accordance with subsection (a), been Wound Up in full on the date on which Insolvency Proceedings in respect of the Institution in Resolution would have commenced; and

60

(c)

assume that the Resolution Action has not been effected.

(5)

The Regulator may set or adopt standards or guidelines for the purpose of a Difference of Treatment Valuation if such a valuation is required or proposed.

(6)

A Difference of Treatment Valuation shall be carried out in accordance with any such standards set or adopted by the Regulator under subsection (5) and otherwise in accordance with applicable accountancy standards.

69.

Safeguard for Shareholders and creditors

If the Difference of Treatment Valuation determines that any Shareholder or creditor or Depositor would incur greater losses than it would incur in a Winding Up under Insolvency Proceedings contrary to the General Resolution Principles under section 25(g), the Shareholder or creditor shall be entitled to the payment of the difference as compensation from the Institution in Resolution or Residual Institution.

70.

Procedural requirements after creation of a Resolution Order or Share Transfer Order

As soon as is reasonably practicable after the creation of a Resolution Order or a Share Transfer Order by which a Resolution Action is taken (including pursuant to a Foreign Resolution Order), the Regulator shall publish or procure the publication of a copy of the Resolution Order or Share Transfer Order or a notice summarising the key terms of the Resolution Order or Share Transfer Order by the following means—

(a)

by publishing it on the websites of both the Regulator and the Institution in Resolution;

(b)

by publishing it on any national or international newspaper available for
