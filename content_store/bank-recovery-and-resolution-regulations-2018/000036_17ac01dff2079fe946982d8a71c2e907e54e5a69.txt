(c)

in the case of Non-CET1 Capital Instruments issued by an ADGM Parent Undertaking or ADGM Subsidiary of an Institution, and where those capital instruments are recognised for the purposes of meeting Capital Resources requirements on an individual and on a consolidated basis, the Regulator determines that unless the Write Down or Conversion Power is exercised the Group would no longer be viable; or

(d)

in the case of Non-CET1 Capital Instruments issued by an ADGM Parent Undertaking or ADGM Subsidiary of a Non-ADGM Financial Institution, and where those capital instruments are recognised for the purposes of meeting own funds or Capital Resource requirements on an individual and on a consolidated basis, the resolution authority of the Non-ADGM Financial Institution or, in the absence of a determination by the resolution authority of the Non-ADGM Financial Institution, the Regulator determines that unless the Write Down or Conversion Power is exercised in relation to those instruments, the Group would no longer be viable.

For the purposes of subsection (3), an Investment Firm is viable unless—

(a)

the Regulator is satisfied that the Investment Firm is failing or likely to fail (within the meaning of section 22); and

(b)

having regard to timing and other relevant circumstances, it is not reasonably likely that any action, apart from the write down or conversion of Non-CET1 Capital Instruments or the application of a Resolution Tool, will be taken by or in respect of the Investment Firm that will prevent the failure or likely failure of the Investment Firm.

For the purposes of subsection (3), a Group is not viable if—

(a)

the Group infringes or in the near future will infringe its consolidated prudential requirements in a way that would justify action by the Regulator; and

(b)

having regard to timing and other relevant circumstances, it is not reasonably likely that any action, apart from the write down or conversion of Non-CET1 Capital

Instruments or the application of a Resolution Tool, will be taken by or in respect of the Investment Firm that will prevent the requirement being infringed.

The Regulator may only exercise the Write Down or Conversion Power under this section after the carrying out a Pre-Resolution Valuation (or a Provisional Valuation if applicable). This Pre- Resolution Valuation (or a Provisional Valuation) shall form the basis of the calculation of the write down to be applied to the Non-CET1 Capital Instruments in order to absorb losses and the level of conversion to be applied to the Non-CET1 Capital Instruments in order to recapitalise the Investment Firm, ADGM Parent Undertaking or ADGM Subsidiary.

If a Recognised Clearing House issues an instrument which would be a Non-CET1 Capital Instrument had the Recognised Clearing House been an Investment Firm, this section and section 65 would apply equally to the Recognised Clearing House as it would to an Investment Firm.

Provisions governing the write down or conversion of Non-CET1 Capital Instruments

In complying with the requirements under section 68, the Regulator shall exercise the Write Down or Conversion Power under section 64 in accordance with the priority of claims under Insolvency Proceedings, in a way that produces the following results—

(a)

Common Equity Tier 1 Capital items are reduced first in proportion to the losses and to the extent of their capacity and the Regulator takes one or both of the actions specified in section 51(1) in respect of the holders of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments;

(b)

the principal amount of Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments is written down or converted into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments or both, to the extent required to achieve the Resolution Objectives or to the extent of the capacity of the Non-CET1 Capital Instruments, whichever is lower; and

(c)

the principal amount of Tier 2 Capital instruments is written down or converted into Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments or both, to the extent required to achieve the Resolution Objectives or to the extent of the capacity of the Non-CET1 Capital Instruments, whichever is lower.

Where the principal amount of a Non-CET1 Capital Instrument is written down—

(a)

the reduction of that principal amount shall be permanent, subject to any write up in accordance with section 50(3
