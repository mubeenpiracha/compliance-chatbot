Early intervention

Where the Regulator is satisfied that an Institution is infringing or is likely, in the near future, to infringe—

(a)

either the minimum capital or liquidity requirements placed on it by the Regulator, including any new or additional capital requirements under sections 16 or 17; or

(b)

the Threshold Conditions or the Recognition Requirements, as applicable,

the Regulator may take any one or more early intervention measures, including those set out in subsection (4), in relation to an Institution.

In this section, "early intervention measure" means a measure which may be taken by the Regulator in the exercise of its powers under these Regulations and the Financial Services and Markets Regulations 2015, with the object of addressing the conditions referred to in subsection (1).

An infringement referred to in subsection (1) may occur due to, among other things, a deteriorating financial condition, and may include one or more of the following—

(a)

a deteriorating funding situation;

(b)

an increasing level of leverage;

(c)

an increasing level of non-performing or defaulting loans; or

(d)

an increasing concentration of exposures.

Early intervention measures include, where applicable, the power of the Regulator to—

(a)

require the Management of the Institution to—

(i)

implement one or more of the arrangements or measures set out in its Recovery Plan; or

(ii)

update its Recovery Plan where the circumstances that led to the early intervention are different from the assumptions in the Recovery Plan and implement one or more of the arrangements or measures set out in the updated Recovery Plan,

within a specified timeframe and in order to ensure that the conditions for early intervention no longer apply;

(b)

require the Management of the Institution to examine the situation, identify measures to overcome any problems identified and draw up an action programme to overcome those problems and a timeframe for its implementation;

require, including through on-site inspections, if necessary, the provision to the Regulator of all information necessary in order to update the Resolution Plan and prepare for the possible Resolution of the Institution and for a Pre-Resolution Valuation to be conducted in accordance with section 35; or

(j)

require the Institution to contact potential purchasers in order to prepare for the Resolution of the Institution, subject to the procedural requirements relating to the Sale of Business Tool.

For each of the early intervention measures set out in subsection (4), the Regulator shall set out an appropriate deadline for completion to enable it to evaluate the effectiveness of the measure.

Temporary administrator

Subject to subsection (2), if the Regulator considers that the replacement of the Management of an Institution as an early intervention measure would be insufficient to remedy the situation, the Regulator may appoint one or more temporary administrators to the Institution.

Before appointing a person as a temporary administrator, the Regulator must be satisfied that the person has the qualifications, ability and
