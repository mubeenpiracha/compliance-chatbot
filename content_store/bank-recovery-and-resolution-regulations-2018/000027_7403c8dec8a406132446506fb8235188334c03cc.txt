Assessment of amount of bail-in

In applying the Bail-in Tool under section 49, the Regulator shall assess for the purposes of subsection (2), on the basis of the Pre-Resolution Valuation, the aggregate of—

(a)

where applicable, the amount by which Eligible Liabilities must be written down in order to ensure that the net asset value of the Institution in Resolution is equal to zero; and

(b)

where applicable, the amount by which Eligible Liabilities must be converted into Shares or other types of capital instruments in order to restore the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of the Institution in Resolution.

The assessment referred to in subsection (1) shall establish the amount by which Eligible Liabilities need to be written down and converted in order—

(a)

to restore the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of the Institution in Resolution;

(b)

to sustain sufficient market confidence in the Institution in Resolution; and

(c)

to enable the Institution to continue, for at least one year, to satisfy the Threshold Conditions or Recognition Requirements and to carry on the activities or services acquired by the virtue of that transfer under the Financial Services and Markets Regulations 2015.

Where capital has been written down in accordance with the Write Down or Conversion Power under section 64, the Bail-in Tool has been applied, and the level of write down based on the Pre-Resolution Valuation is found to exceed requirements when assessed against the Definitive Valuation, a write up mechanism shall be applied to reimburse creditors and then Shareholders to the extent necessary.

provided that, in accordance with the Pre-Resolution Valuation (or Provisional Valuation, if applicable), the Institution in Resolution has a positive net value, dilute existing Shareholders as a result of the conversion into Shares of—

pursuant to the conversion of Non-CET1 Capital Instruments to Common Equity Tier 1 Capital instruments, under the Write Down or Conversion Power under section 64.

In considering which action to take in accordance with subsection (1), the Regulator shall have regard to—

the Pre-Resolution Valuation (or Provisional Valuation, if applicable);
