 not been fully converted—

terms that provide for the principal amount of the instrument to be reduced on the occurrence of any event that refers to the financial situation, viability, solvency or levels of Capital Resources of the Institution; or

(b)

terms that provide for the conversion of the instrument to Shares on the occurrence of any such event.

Where the principal amount of an instrument has been reduced, but not reduced to zero, in accordance with terms referred to in subsection (3)(a) before the application of the bail-in pursuant to subsection (1), the Regulator shall apply the Write Down or Conversion Power to the residual amount of that principal amount in accordance with subsection (1).

In deciding on whether liabilities are to be written down or converted into Shares, the Regulator shall not convert one class of liabilities while a class of liabilities that is subordinated to that class remains substantially unconverted into Shares or not written down, unless otherwise permitted under subsections 49(7) and (8).

Derivatives

The Regulator shall be entitled to exercise the Write Down or Conversion Power in relation to a liability arising from a Derivative Contract only when, upon or after closing-out that Derivative Contract, there is a net liability which is an Eligible Liability.

The Regulator may terminate and close out any Derivative Contract upon an Institution's entry into Resolution for the purpose of realising an Eligible Liability that is to be subject to the Write Down or Conversion Power under subsection (1).

Where an Eligible Liability under a Derivative Contract has been excluded from the application of the Bail-in Tool pursuant to section 49(8), the Regulator shall not be under any obligation to terminate or close out the Derivative Contract.

Where a Derivative Contract is subject to a netting agreement, the value of the Eligible Liability for the purposes of the Pre-Resolution Valuation (or Provisional Valuation, if applicable) shall be determined on a net basis in accordance with the terms of the agreement.

The Regulator shall determine the value of Eligible Liabilities arising from Derivative Contracts in accordance with the following—

(b)

principles for establishing the relevant point in time at which the value of a derivative position shall be established; and

(c)

appropriate methodologies for comparing the destruction of value that would arise from the close out and bail-in of Derivative Contracts with the amount of losses that would be borne by Derivative Contracts in a bail-in.

Rate of conversion of debt to equity

When the Write Down or Conversion Power is exercised, the Regulator may apply a different Conversion Rate to different classes of Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital instruments and Eligible Liabilities in accordance with one or both of the following principles—

(a)

the Conversion Rate shall represent appropriate compensation to the Affected Creditor for any loss incurred by virtue of the exercise of the Write Down or Conversion Power; and

(b)

when different Conversion Rates are applied, the Conversion Rate applicable to liabilities that are considered to be senior under the ADGM Insolvency Regulations shall be higher than the Conversion Rate applicable to subordinated liabilities.

Business Reorganisation Plan

Where the Bail-in Tool has been used to recapitalise an Institution, the Regulator shall ensure that a Business Reorganisation Plan for the Institution is drawn up and implemented in accordance with this section.

The implementation of a Business Reorganisation Plan may include the appointment by the Regulator of persons (pursuant to its general power to exercise control over an Institution in Resolution under section 58(1)(b)) for the purpose of drawing up and implementing the Business Reorganisation Plan.

Within one month after the application of the Bail-in Tool to an Institution, the Management of the Institution shall draw up and submit to the Regulator a Business Reorganisation Plan that satisfies the requirements in subsection (6).

Where the Bail-in Tool is applied to two or more Group Entities, including where a Foreign Resolution Order has been made, a Group level Business Reorganisation Plan may be accepted by the Regulator for the purpose of this section.

In exceptional circumstances, and if it is necessary for achieving the Resolution Objectives, the Regulator may extend the period in subsection (3
