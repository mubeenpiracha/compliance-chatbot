 while changing its legal form if the Regulator is of the view that changing the legal form is necessary to achieve the Resolution Objectives.

The Bail-in Tool may be applied in respect of any liability of an Institution, provided that the liability is not excluded from the scope of the Bail-in Tool under subsection (1), (7) or (8).

The Regulator shall not exercise the Write Down or Conversion Power in relation to the following liabilities whether they are governed by the laws of the ADGM or by the law of another jurisdiction—

(a)

secured liabilities (including, but not limited to, Covered Bonds, liabilities in the form of financial instruments used for hedging purposes which form an integral part of the cover pool and which according to the ADGM law are secured in a way similar to Covered Bonds and financial collateral arrangements and liabilities under Derivative Contracts, to the extent the liabilities thereunder are secured), but this exclusion shall not prevent any liability in respect of net sum following close out of a Derivative Contract, to the extent it is an unsecured liability;

(b)

any liability that arises by virtue of the holding of Client Assets by the Institution that is not an ADGM Branch;

(c)

any liability that arises by virtue of a fiduciary relationship between the Institution (as fiduciary) and another person (as beneficiary) provided that such beneficiary's interests are protected under ADGM Insolvency Regulations or civil law;

(d)

liabilities to Institutions excluding entities that are part of the same Group, with an original maturity of less than seven days;

(e)

liabilities owed to payment and securities settlement systems. Central Securities Depositories, clearing houses, Recognised Clearing Houses or their operators or their participants and arising from the participation in any such system; or

(f)

a liability to any one of the following—

(i)

an employee, in relation to accrued salary, pension benefits or other fixed remuneration, except for the variable component of remuneration that is not regulated by a collective bargaining agreement;

43

(8)

(9)

(10)

(ii)

a commercial or trade creditor arising from the provision to the Institution in Resolution of goods and services that are critical to the daily functioning of its operations, including information technology services, utilities and rental, servicing and upkeep of premises; or

(iii)

any tax and social security authority or scheme in the UAE.

In exceptional circumstances, where the Bail-in Tool is applied, the Regulator may exclude or partially exclude certain liabilities from the application of the Write Down or Conversion Power where—

(a)

it is not possible to bail-in that liability within a reasonable time despite the reasonable efforts of the Regulator;

(b)

the exclusion is strictly necessary and is proportionate to achieve the continuity of Critical Functions and Core Business Lines in a manner that maintains the ability of the Institution in Resolution to continue key operations, services and transactions;

(c)

the exclusion is strictly necessary and proportionate to avoid giving rise to widespread contagion, in particular as regards Deposits and Eligible Deposits which would severely disrupt the functioning of financial markets, including financial market infrastructures, in a manner that could cause broader financial instability; or

(d)

the application of the Bail-in Tool to those liabilities would cause a destruction of value such that the losses borne by other creditors would be higher than if those liabilities were excluded from bail-in.

Where the Regulator decides to exclude or partially exclude an Eligible Liability or class of Eligible Liabilities under subsection (8), the level of write down or conversion applied to other Eligible Liabilities may be increased to take account of such exclusions, provided that the level of write down or conversion applied to other Eligible Liabilities complies with the General Resolution Principles specified in section 25(g).

In exercising its discretion under subsection (8), the Regulator shall give due consideration to—

(a)

the need not to apply any bail-in to a netting set prior to such netting being completed;

(b)

the need to avoid disruption to payment and securities settlement systems, Central Securities Depositories, clearing houses and Recognised Clearing Houses;

(c)

the principle that losses shall be borne first by Shareholders and subsequently by creditors of the Institution in Resolution in order of preference in light of section 25(g);

(d)

the level of loss absorbing capacity that would remain in the Institution in Resolution if the liability or class of liabilities were excluded; and

(e)

the need to maintain adequate resources for Resolution financing
