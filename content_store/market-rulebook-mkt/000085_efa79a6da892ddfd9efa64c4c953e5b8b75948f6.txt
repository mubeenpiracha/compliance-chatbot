)

include the aggregation method used, which must be either:

(i)

an arithmetic summation by category (being C1, C2 or C3); or

(ii)

a statistical aggregation of uncertainty distributions up to the field, property of project level; and

(b)

where Rule 12.9.1(3)(a)(i) applies, include a statement to the effect that the aggregate C1 may be a very conservative estimate and the aggregate C3 may be a very optimistic estimate due to the portfolio effects of arithmetic summation.

Guidance

The Petroleum Reporting Standard defines ‘aggregated’ in section 4.2.5 and its Appendix A. Sections 1.1, 2.1, 4.1, 5.1, 6.26 and 8.1 of the PRMS Guidelines provide additional guidance concerning aggregation.

12.10 Contingent Resources – Material Changes

12.10.1 A Petroleum Reporting Entity disclosing estimates of Contingent Resources that are material, and that have not previously been disclosed by the Petroleum Reporting Entity, must ensure the disclosure contains:

(1)

the types of permits or licences held by the Petroleum Reporting Entity relevant to the disclosed estimates of Contingent Resources;

Confidential

140

MKT VER09.020125

(2) the basis for, confirming the existence of a significant quantity of potentially

moveable Petroleum, and the determination of a discovery;

(3) a description of:

(a)

the method of estimation;

(b)

the key contingencies that resulted in the estimates being classified as Contingent Resources;

(c)

any further appraisal drilling and evaluation work to be undertaken to assess the potential for commercial recovery, and to progress the relevant project;

(4)

if the disclosed estimates of Contingent Resources are contingent on technology under development, to ensure that Unrecoverable quantities are not classified as part of the Contingent Resources, an explanation of whether the technology has:

(a)

been demonstrated to be commercially viable in analogous reservoirs;

(b)

been demonstrated to be commercially viable in other reservoirs that are not analogous, and that a pilot project, which is planned and budgeted, will be necessary to demonstrate commerciality for this reservoir; or

(c)

not been demonstrated to be commercially viable, but is currently under active development, and there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the technology may reasonably be expected to be available for commercial application within five years; and

(5)

if the disclosed estimates of Contingent Resources relate to Unconventional Petroleum Resources, the:

(a)

type(s) of Unconventional Contingent Resource;

(b)

land area;

(c)

number of wells; and

(d)

specialised extraction technology proposed to be utilised.

Guidance

The Petroleum Reporting Standard defines ‘unconventional resources’ in section 2.4 and its Appendix A. Sections 1.1 and 8.6 of the PRMS Guidelines provide additional guidance on Unconventional Petroleum Resources.

12.11 Petroleum Reserves

12.11.1 A Petroleum Reporting Entity disclosing estimates of Petroleum Reserves must

comply with the following:

Confidential

141

MKT VER09.020125

(1)

the term ‘reserves’ must only be used for estimates of commercially recoverable quantities of Petroleum;

(2) Petroleum Reserves must be categorised and disclosed as either 1P, 2P or 3P in the most specific category that best reflects the degree of uncertainty in the estimated quantities of recoverable Petroleum, and if an estimate of 3P is disclosed, also disclose estimates of 2P and 1P;

(3)

the Reference Point used for the purpose of measuring and assessing the estimated Petroleum Reserves must be identified;

Guidance

Sections 7.1 and 9.13 of the PRMS Guidelines provide specific guidance on Reference Points.

(4)

If Petroleum Reserves are not disclosed net of CiO up to the Reference Point, the disclosure is to identify the portion of the Petroleum Reserves that will be consumed as fuel in production and lease plant operations;

Guidance

Section 9.1 of the PRMS Guidelines provide specific guidance on CiO (lease fuel).

(5)

it must not disclose a mean estimate of Petroleum Reserves;

(6) where the disclosure represents aggregated estimates of Petroleum Reserves:

(a)

it must include the aggregation method used, which
