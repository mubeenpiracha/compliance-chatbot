Guidance

1.

The Prospectus requirements including content and structure in chapter 4 of this Rulebook do not apply to Prospectuses relating to Units of Funds. Prospectus requirements that apply to an Offer of Units of Funds are found in the Fund Rules. Section 57(1) of FSMR disapplies chapter 4 of this Rulebook to Fund Prospectuses.

2.

However a Prospectus is required for the purposes of admitting any Financial Instruments, including Units, to trading on a Recognised Investment Exchange, as these fall within the definition of "Securities" for the purposes of Part 6 of FSMR. The Rules in this Rule 3.3 are designed to enable a Person seeking to have Units of a Fund admitted to trading on a Recognised Investment Exchange to be able to use a Prospectus prepared in accordance with the requirements in the Fund Rules if it is a Domestic Fund. In the case of Foreign Funds, the Offer documents or admission to trading documents prepared in accordance with the requirements in a foreign jurisdiction will be acceptable in the circumstances prescribed in this section.
