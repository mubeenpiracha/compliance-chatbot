an at least equally prominent, and proximate, statement to the effect that:

“The level of geological confidence associated with inferred mineral resources is low. Though further evaluation and/or exploration work is required to establish sufficient confidence that the production target will be met, there is no certainty that further evaluation and/or exploration work will result in the determination of indicated mineral resources or that the production target itself will be realised. The mining reporting entity’s production target is based on its current expectation of future results or events, and should not be solely relied upon by investors when making investment decisions.”
