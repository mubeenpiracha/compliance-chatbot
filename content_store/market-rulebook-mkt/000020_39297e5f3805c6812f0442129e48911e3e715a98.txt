(2)

A Fund Prospectus is not an Approved Prospectus for the purposes of section 61(2) of FSMR unless the Regulator has issued to the Applicant a notice stating its approval:

(a)

of the Prospectus or Supplementary Prospectus, as the case may be; and

(b)

in the case of a Prospectus in (a) comprising multiple documents, of all the multiple documents.

Guidance

1.

A Person intending to apply to the Regulator for approval of a Fund Prospectus pursuant to Rule 3.3.1 should consider submitting a draft Prospectus for preliminary review by the Regulator prior to formally submitting the Prospectus for the Regulator's approval. See the GPM for procedures for applying for the Regulator's approval.

2.

The approval of a Fund Prospectus by the Regulator will not prevent the use by the Regulator of its powers, such as the stop order power in section 71 of FSMR, in circumstances where the need for such action is subsequently identified. For example, if the Regulator becomes aware, after the approval of the Fund Prospectus, that it contains any false, misleading, or deceptive information, or if it breaches the Prospectus provisions in other respects, the Regulator may use its powers or take any other action as appropriate in the circumstances.

3.3.3

in a jurisdiction which provides a level of regulation relating to the Offer which is acceptable to the Regulator.

(2)

The Regulator may accept an Offer document or admission to trading document referred to in (1)(b) subject to such conditions or restrictions imposed by the Regulator as it sees fit.

(3)

Where the Offer document or admission to trading document referred to in (1) is not in the English language, it must be accompanied by an English translation acceptable to the Regulator.

Publication of a Prospectus

3.3.4 A Fund Prospectus approved by the Regulator pursuant to Rule 3.3.1 must:

(1)

be filed with the Recognised Investment Exchange on which the Units are to be admitted to trading as soon as possible after the Regulator has granted its approval; and
