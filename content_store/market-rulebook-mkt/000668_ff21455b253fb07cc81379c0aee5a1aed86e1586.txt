WILL WE BE PAYING [DIVIDENDS/DISTRIBUTIONS] AFTER THE OFFER?

[Describe (i) the dividends/distributions per share/unit, if any, paid by the Issuer for each of the 3 most recent completed financial years, and (ii) the Issuer’s dividend/distribution policy, or if it does not have a fixed policy, to state so. Provide clear and prominent disclosure of any existing or proposed arrangement that materially enhances short-term yields while potentially diluting long- term yields. The disclosure should include a computation of the forecast distribution yield assuming that the arrangements are not in place.]
