Application to Listed Funds

5.

Where Units of a Fund are admitted to the Official List, such a Fund is a Listed Fund. A reference to a Reporting Entity in relation to a Listed Fund is a reference to the Fund Manager of that Fund, unless another person has been declared by the Regulator as the Reporting Entity of the Fund.

6.

Accordingly, any obligations of a Reporting Entity of a Listed Fund are, unless the context requires otherwise, obligations imposed on the Reporting Entity in respect of the Listed Fund. Therefore, the obligations imposed by FSMR and these Rules apply to the Governing Body of the Reporting Entity and to every member of the Governing Body in the manner specified in Rules 1.1.2 and 1.1.3.
