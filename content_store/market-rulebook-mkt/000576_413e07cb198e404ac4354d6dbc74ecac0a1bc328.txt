APP 4 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE BEST PRACTICE STANDARDS

General

1.

This Appendix sets out, by way of Guidance, best practice standards relevant to each of the Corporate Governance Principles (the "Principles") set out in Rule 9.2. While the Principles have the status of Rules that apply to a Reporting Entity/Listed Entity, the standards in this document are best practice standards that may be adopted by a Reporting Entity/Listed Entity to achieve compliance with the Principles.

2.

A Reporting Entity to which the Principles apply is required under Rule 9.2.10 to state in its annual report whether the best practice standards have been adopted. In circumstances where a Reporting Entity has not fully adopted or only partially adopted the best practice standards, it needs to explain in its annual report why the standards were not fully adopted or adopted only partially and what actions, if any, it has taken to achieve compliance with the Principles.
