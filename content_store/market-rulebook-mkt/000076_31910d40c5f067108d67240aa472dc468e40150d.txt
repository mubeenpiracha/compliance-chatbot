must ensure that the disclosure contains the following:

(1)

a prominent, and proximate, statement to the effect that:

Confidential

MKT VER09.020125

(a)

the estimates are Non-Equivalent Estimates and are not disclosed in accordance with a Mining Reporting Standard;

(b)

a Competent Person has not done sufficient work to classify the Non- Equivalent Estimates as Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves in accordance with a Mining Reporting Standard; and

(c)

it is uncertain whether, following evaluation and/or further Exploration work, the Non-Equivalent Estimates will ever be able to be disclosed as Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves in accordance with a Mining Reporting Standard.

(2)

the source(s) and date(s) of the Non-Equivalent Estimates;

(3)

if the Non-Equivalent Estimates use categories of Mineralisation, a statement identifying whether the categories used:

(a)

are different to those defined in a Mining Reporting Standard, and an explanation of the differences; or

(b)

are the same as those defined in a Mining Reporting Standard;

(4)

the relevance of the Non-Equivalent Estimates to the Mining Reporting Entity;

(5)

the reliability of the Non-Equivalent Estimates;

Guidance: For example, the Mining Reporting Entity may want to have regard to the relevant criteria listed in Table 1 of the JORC Code.

(6)

a summary of the evaluation and/or exploration work on which the Non- Equivalent Estimates are based;

(7)

a summary of the key assumptions, mining and processing parameters and methods used to prepare the Non-Equivalent Estimates;

(8)

details of any more recent estimates or data relevant to interpreting the Non- Equivalent Estimates, and the source(s) and date(s) of the estimates or data;

(9)

the evaluation and/or exploration work that needs to be undertaken to verify the Non-Equivalent Estimates as Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves in accordance with a Mining Reporting Standard;

(10)

the proposed timing of the evaluation and/or exploration work disclosed in (9);

(11)

the proposed source of funding for the evaluation and/or exploration work disclosed pursuant to (9);

(12)

the mineral resources classification and reporting standard used in determining the Non-Equivalent Estimates; and

Confidential

125

MKT VER09.020125

(13)

a statement by a named Competent Person(s) that the information in the disclosure provided pursuant to (3) to (9) is an accurate representation of the available data and studies relating to the Non-Equivalent Estimates.

11.7.4 If a Mining Reporting Entity has disclosed Non-Equivalent Estimates that comply with the requirements of Rule 11.7.3, then any subsequent disclosure made in respect of the Non- Equivalent Estimates does not need to include the information in that Rule if the subsequent disclosure:

(1)

references the earlier disclosure that was in compliance with that Rule;

(2)

contains a confirmation from the Mining Reporting Entity that:

(a)

the information provided in the earlier disclosure in compliance with that Rule continues to apply; and

(b)

there is no new material information or data relating to the Non- Equivalent Estimates that impacts on the:

(i)

reliability or interpretation of the Non-Equivalent Estimates; or

(ii)

Mining Reporting Entity’s ability to verify the Non-Equivalent Estimates as Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves in accordance with a Mining Reporting Standard; and

(3)

includes an at least equally prominent, and proximate, statement about the disclosed Non-Equivalent Estimates addressing the matters contained in Rule 11.7.3(1).

11.7.5 A Mining Reporting Entity must ensure that Non-Equivalent Estimates of Mineralisation are not in a Technical Study of the Mining Reporting Entity’s Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves Holdings.

Non-Equivalent Estimates – Summary of Reserves and Resources

11.7.6 If a Mining Reporting Entity has previously disclosed Non-Equivalent Estimates compliance with Rule 11.7.3 which have not subsequently been disclosed as Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves in accordance with a Mining Reporting Standard, then:

(1)

the Mining Reporting Entity must disclose in its Summary of Reserves and Resources, the:

(a)

steps it has taken in evaluating the previously disclosed Non-Equivalent Estimates;

(b)

status of
