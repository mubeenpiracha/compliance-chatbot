(c)

is a Person exercising or having the ability to exercise significant influence over the Listed Entity or a Related Party Associate of such a Person.

(2)

Subject to Rule 9.5.4, a transaction is a Related Party Transaction if it is a transaction:

(a)

between a Listed Entity and a Related Party;

(b)

entered into pursuant to an arrangement between the Listed Entity and the Related Party under which the Listed Entity and the Related Party both invest in another Undertaking or asset, or provide financial assistance to another Undertaking;

(c)

(d)

of the kind referred to in (a) to (c) and is between a subsidiary of a Listed Entity and a Related Party of the Listed Entity.

Guidance

1.

A Person is regarded as exercising significant influence over a Listed Entity if, for example, that Person is a consultant or adviser or a shadow director of the Listed Entity. For the purposes of this guidance, “shadow director” means a Person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the Directors of the Listed Entity are accustomed to act.

2.

Any transactions between a subsidiary of a Listed Entity and a Related Party are included within the definition of a Related Party Transaction. This is because a Related Party may, through the Listed Entity, be able to influence terms which are more favourable to the Related Party when transacting with the subsidiary. Such transactions could be detrimental to the interests of the Listed Entity.

Related Party Transaction procedures

9.5.3 A Listed Entity must ensure that:

(1)

if the value of a proposed Related Party Transaction is equal to or greater than 5% of the value of the net assets of the Listed Entity as stated in its most recent financial reports, it does not enter into such a transaction unless the proposed transaction has been put to Shareholder approval and has received prior approval by a majority of the Shareholders of the Listed Entity;

(2)

if the value of the proposed Related Party Transaction is less than the 5% threshold referred to in (1), the Reporting Entity must as soon as possible after entering the transaction:

(a)

notify the Regulator of the relevant terms and the basis on which such terms are considered fair and reasonable, supported by written confirmation by an independent third party; and

(b)

Disclose the Related Party Transaction in accordance with Rule 7.7.1;

(3)

if the cumulative value of a series of Related Party Transactions with the same Related Party which have not received Shareholder approval reaches the 5% threshold referred to in (1) in any 12 month period, it does not enter into the last of the series of the transactions unless such proposed action has been put to Shareholder approval and received approval by a majority of the Shareholders in voting of the Listed Entity;

(4)

if, after obtaining Shareholder approval pursuant to Rule 9.5.3(1) but before the completion of the Related Party Transaction, there is a material change to the terms of the proposed transaction, the Listed Entity must comply again separately with Rule 9.5.3(1) in relation to the Related Party Transaction; or

(5)

the Related Party does not vote on the Shareholder resolution referred to in Rule 9.5.3(1) and takes all reasonable steps to ensure that any Related Party Associates of the relevant Related Party also do not vote on the Shareholder resolution.
