Guidance

Particular care should be taken so that the financial information in a Prospectus is not outdated. For example, in respect of the last year of audited financial information included in a Prospectus, such information is required, under Rule A1.1.1 (item 7.1) of APP 1, not to be older than 18 months from the date of the Registration Statement where the Issuer includes audited interim financial statements in the Registration Statement and, not to be older than 15 months, if such interim financial statements are unaudited.

4.9.2 Where Rule 4.9.1 applies, any reference in these Rules to a Prospectus must be read as a reference to a Prospectus as amended by a Supplementary Prospectus unless the context requires otherwise.

4.9.3 When a Supplementary Prospectus has been filed for the purposes of the requirement in Rule 4.9.1(1), the Person responsible for producing the Supplementary Prospectus must:

(1)

inform offerees of their right to confirm or withdraw their agreement to buy or subscribe for the Securities made on the basis of the original Prospectus and the manner in which to do so; and

(2)

allow the offeree a period of at least seven Business Days from the date of receipt of the Supplementary Prospectus in which to confirm or withdraw its agreement.
