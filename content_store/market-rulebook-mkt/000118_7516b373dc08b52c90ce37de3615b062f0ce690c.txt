Disclosure of notifiable interests

Application

3.7.1 This section applies to every member of the Governing Body of a Listed Fund.

Guidance

1.

Persons with a notifiable interest in the Reporting Entity or Listed Fund are required to make a Disclosure relating to that interest in accordance with the requirements prescribed in this Section.

2.

In the case of a Listed Fund, the Reporting Entity is the Fund Manager, unless another Person has been declared by the Regulator as the Reporting Entity of the Fund. However, as the Governing Body of a Listed Fund may include other Persons who exercise powers similar to those that are exercised by Directors of the Fund Manager, the obligations relating to disclosure of notifiable interests extend, in the case of a Listed Fund, to members of its Governing Body.
