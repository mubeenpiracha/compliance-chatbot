The Regulator will expect a Person referred to in Rule 9.3.1 to consider references to a “Shareholder” in this section to refer equally to holders of all classes of Securities as may be applicable in the context of the Listed Entity. For example, in a situation where holders of Debentures are to be asked to vote on a variation of rights or terms, the Regulator will expect a Person referred to in Rule 9.3.1 to give due consideration to the requirements of Rules 9.3.6 and 9.3.7 as if it referred to the relevant Debenture holders.
