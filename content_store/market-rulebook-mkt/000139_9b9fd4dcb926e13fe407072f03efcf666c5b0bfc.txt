The most significant factors contributing to our financial performance over the last two completed financial years are as follows:

Our revenue for [year] increased by $[●] million ([●]%) due to an increase in sales volume contributed by our introduction of our new product in [year].

Our net profit from operations in [year] was $[●] million, which is [●]% higher than our net profit from operations of $[●] million in [year]. This was mainly attributable to lower finance costs of $[●] million due to lower interest rates and lower loan principals. • Our net cash generated from operating activities decreased by $[●] million from $[●] million in [year] to $[●] million in [year] due to an increase in credit sales that contributed to an increase in trade receivables of $[●] million from $[●] million in [year] to $[●] million in [year].

Our net assets increased by $[●] million from $[●] million in [year] to $[●] million in [year] mainly due to the $[●] million increase in inventories for our new product introduced in [year].

The above factors are not the only factors contributing to our financial performance in FY[●] and FY[●]. Please refer to the other factors set out in pages [●] to [●] of the Offer document.
