moveable Petroleum, and the determination of a discovery;

(3) a description of:

(a)

the method of estimation;

(b)

the key contingencies that resulted in the estimates being classified as Contingent Resources;

(c)

any further appraisal drilling and evaluation work to be undertaken to assess the potential for commercial recovery, and to progress the relevant project;

(4)

if the disclosed estimates of Contingent Resources are contingent on technology under development, to ensure that Unrecoverable quantities are not classified as part of the Contingent Resources, an explanation of whether the technology has:

(a)

been demonstrated to be commercially viable in analogous reservoirs;

(b)

been demonstrated to be commercially viable in other reservoirs that are not analogous, and that a pilot project, which is planned and budgeted, will be necessary to demonstrate commerciality for this reservoir; or

(c)

not been demonstrated to be commercially viable, but is currently under active development, and there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the technology may reasonably be expected to be available for commercial application within five years; and
