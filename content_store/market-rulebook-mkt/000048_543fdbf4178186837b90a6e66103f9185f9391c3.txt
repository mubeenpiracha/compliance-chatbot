(3)

The terms of appointment of a Stabilisation Agent must not create a legal relationship other than that of principal and agent whereby the Stabilisation Manager as principal is responsible and liable for any and all acts carried out by its Stabilisation Agent.

6.2.15 Restrictions on transactions with Stabilisation Agents

(1)

A Stabilisation Manager must not during the Stabilisation Window enter into a transaction as principal with any of his Stabilisation Agents in the Relevant Securities which are the subject of Price Stabilisation.

(2)

The requirement in (1) does not apply:

(a)

if at the time of the transaction, neither the Stabilisation Manager nor his Stabilisation Agent knew or could reasonably have known the identity of his counterparty; or

(b)

where the transaction between the Stabilisation Manager and his Stabilisation Agent is undertaken solely for the purpose of reallocating the risk of positions that were taken by the Stabilisation Manager and his Stabilisation Agent in the course of Price Stabilisation and the transaction is priced accordingly.

Guidance

Some participants in the Price Stabilisation may have accrued positions during stabilisation and Rule 6.2.15 permits transactions to ‘square-off’ the positions between participants. The terms on which these transactions may be carried may often be agreed in the terms of engagement between the Stabilisation Manager and his Stabilisation Agents. The Regulator may when inspecting records kept relating to stabilisation seek the rationale for any of these transactions and the price at which they were conducted.

6.2.16 Price Stabilisation Register

(1)

The Stabilisation Manager must, before carrying out any Price Stabilisation:

(a)

create a register to record the details relating to the Price Stabilisation as required by Rule 6.2.7 to 6.2.16; and

(b)

establish and implement systems and controls to keep the register updated.

(2)

The Stabilisation Manager must ensure that the register contains either on a real- time or daily updated basis the following information:
