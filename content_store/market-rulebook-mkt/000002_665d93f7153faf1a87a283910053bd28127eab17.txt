INTRODUCTION

1.1

Application

1.1.1

(1)

The Rules in this Rulebook ("MKT") are made for the purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Regulations 2015 ("FSMR") and apply to every Person to whom that legislation applies. For the purposes of these Rules the Regulator may refer to itself as the Listing Authority.

(b)

Guidance

Listed Entities and Reporting Entities

1.

Where Securities (other than Units of a Fund) are admitted to the Official List, the Issuer of such Securities is a Listed Entity.

2.

In the circumstance described in paragraph 1 above, a reference in MKT to the Reporting Entity may either refer to:

a.

the Listed Entity itself; or,

b.

whichever entity is designated by the Regulator as the Reporting Entity of that Listed Entity.

3.

An example of where the Regulator may designate an entity other than the Listed Entity to be the Reporting Entity is where “Company A” has issued a Debenture via a subsidiary securitisation vehicle “SPV X”. Whilst the Debentures of SPV X may be admitted to the Official List, making it a Listed Entity, it is unlikely to have the operational capacity to be a Reporting Entity in its own right. In such circumstances the Regulator will designate Company A as the Reporting Entity for the Debentures admitted to the Official List.

4.

Therefore, any reference to a Reporting Entity in MKT should be read in the context applicable to a particular Listed Entity and any associated entities.

Application to Listed Funds

5.

Where Units of a Fund are admitted to the Official List, such a Fund is a Listed Fund. A reference to a Reporting Entity in relation to a Listed Fund is a reference to the Fund Manager of that Fund, unless another person has been declared by the Regulator as the Reporting Entity of the Fund.

6.

Accordingly, any obligations of a Reporting Entity of a Listed
