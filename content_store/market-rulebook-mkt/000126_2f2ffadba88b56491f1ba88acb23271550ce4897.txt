The Regulator also has the power under section 61(3) of FSMR to prescribe certain types of:

a.

Offers of Securities as "Exempt Offers"; and

b.

Securities to be "Exempt Securities".

Pursuant to section 58 of FSMR, Exempt Offers and Exempt Securities do not require a Prospectus.

4.2

Exempt Communications

Guidance

For the purposes of section 59(c) of FSMR, Exempt Communications are not Offers of Securities and therefore do not attract the Prospectus requirements in FSMR and Rules.

4.2.1 A communication is prescribed by the Regulator as an Exempt Communication if it is

made in:

(a)

connection with the trading of Securities that are listed and traded on a Regulated Exchange; and

(b)

the ordinary course of business of an Authorised Person, Recognised Body or Remote Member.
