Guidance

Rule 11.2.1(1) requires a Mining Reporting Entity to fully comply with all binding requirements set out in a Mining Reporting Standard. The Regulator also expects a Mining Reporting Entity to fully comply with all non-mandatory requirements set out in a Mining Reporting Standard, including, for example, Table 1 of the JORC Code or SAMREC Code, or explain its non-compliance in accordance with Rule 11.2.2.

11.2.3 If a Mining Reporting Entity changes the basis upon which it makes disclosures from a one Mining Reporting Standard (the “Initial Mining Reporting Standard”) to a new different Mining Reporting Standard (the “New Mining Reporting Standard”), then the Mining Reporting Entity must, when first making a disclosure under the New Mining Reporting Standard, disclose a reconciliation of the differences between the disclosures under the Initial Mining Reporting Standard and the disclosures under the New Mining Reporting Standard.
