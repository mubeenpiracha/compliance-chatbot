Issues of New Securities

Guidance

This section applies to a Listed Entity and sets out details on the restrictions on the issue by a Listed Entity of new Equity Securities, exceptions to these restrictions and the process for approval or ratification by Listed Entities. Due to the complexity that often surrounds a new issue of Securities, Listed Entities are encouraged to discuss the proposal of a new issue of Equity Securities with the Regulator before the terms of any new issue are finalised.

Restrictions on new Issues of Equity Securities

9.7.1 A Listed Entity must not issue, or agree to issue, more Equity Securities than the number calculated according to the following formula, without the approval of the holders of Ordinary Securities:

Maximum number of Equity Securities = (20% * Base Amount) – Relevant Issues),

where:

Base Amount = the number of fully paid Ordinary Securities on issue as of the date 12 months before the date of issue or agreement (the “12 months Base Amount”), plus the number of:

(1)

fully paid Ordinary Securities issued in the 12 months before the date of issue or agreement under an exception in Rule 9.7.4 other than exceptions (8), (15) or (16);

(2)

fully paid Ordinary Securities issued in the 12 months before the date of issue or agreement under an exception in Rule 9.7.4 other than exception (15), where the agreement was:

(i)

entered into before the commencement of the 12 month period; or

(ii)

approved, or taken under the Rules to have been approved, under Rule 9.7.1 or Rule 9.7.5; and

(3)

any other fully paid Ordinary Securities issued in the 12 months before the date of issue or agreement with approval under Rule 9.7.1 or Rule 9.7.5;

Guidance

The Base Amount may include fully paid Ordinary Securities issued in the 12 months before the date of issue or agreement under an agreement to issue Securities within Rule 9.7.4 exception (14) where the issue is subsequently approved under Rule 9.7.1.

(4)

partly paid Ordinary Securities that became fully paid in the 12 months before the date of issue or agreement,

but subtracting the number of fully paid Ordinary Securities cancelled in the 12 months before the date of issue or agreement.
