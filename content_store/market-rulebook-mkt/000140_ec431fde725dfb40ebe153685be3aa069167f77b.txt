KEY RISKS

We consider the following to be the most important key risks which had materially affected or could materially affect our business operations, financial position and results, and your investment in our shares.

An economic downturn could negatively affect our profitability: Our industry is exposed to cyclical variations in the general economy and to uncertainty of future economic prospects. Economic downturns could have an adverse impact on overall demand. This would result in a decrease in our sales and earnings.

Our industry is highly competitive: We compete against numerous businesses and our competitors may be larger and have greater financial resources. We compete for customers, financing, employees and other resources. This creates both strong price and quality competition, which leads to increased costs in the form of marketing and customer services, in addition to price reductions. Our ability to compete effectively depends on several factors, including our market presence, our reputation, our competitors, and general trends in the industry and economy. There is no assurance that we can compete successfully.

A substantial proportion of our revenues is derived from several major customers and loss of their business may seriously impact our financial results: Our five largest customers accounted for approximately [●]% of our revenues for the year ended [year], and our ten largest customers accounted for approximately [●]% of our revenues for the year ended [year]. Our revenues may significantly decrease if we lose any of these
