4.9.2 Where Rule 4.9.1 applies, any reference in these Rules to a Prospectus must be read as a reference to a Prospectus as amended by a Supplementary Prospectus unless the context requires otherwise.

4.9.3 When a Supplementary Prospectus has been filed for the purposes of the requirement in Rule 4.9.1(1), the Person responsible for producing the Supplementary Prospectus must:
