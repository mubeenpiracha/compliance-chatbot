Guidance

1.

The Corporate Governance Principles in this section apply to Reporting Entities as mandatory high level requirements. APP 4 sets out best practice standards that may be adopted by a Reporting Entity to achieve compliance with these principles.

2.

The best practice standards in APP 4 are designed to provide a degree of flexibility so that a Reporting Entity can achieve outcomes intended by the Corporate Governance Principles whilst taking into account the nature, scale and complexity of its business.

3.

Generally, if a Reporting Entity does not adopt the best practice standards set out in APP 4, or adopts them only partially, the Regulator would expect the reasons for doing so and any alternative measures adopted to achieve the outcomes intended by the Corporate Governance Principles to be disclosed in the Prospectus and thereafter pursuant to the Disclosure required under Rule 9.2.10. Any inaccurate or false representations would lead to the imposition of civil liability in accordance with section 70 of FSMR.
