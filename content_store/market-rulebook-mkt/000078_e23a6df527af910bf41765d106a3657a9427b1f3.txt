(a)

an explanation as to why the Mining Reporting Entity believes it has a reasonable basis for disclosing a Production Target wholly based on Inferred Mineral Resources;

(b)

the level of confidence in relation to which the Inferred Mineral Resources are estimated and the basis for that level of confidence;

(c)

a Technical Study of a sufficient level of confidence to support the Production Target, prepared by, or under the supervision of, a named independent Competent Person(s); and

(d)

an at least equally prominent, and proximate, statement to the effect that:

“The level of geological confidence associated with inferred mineral resources is low. Though further evaluation and/or exploration work is required to establish sufficient confidence that the production target will be met, there is no certainty that further evaluation and/or exploration work will result in the determination of indicated mineral resources or that the production target itself will be realised. The mining reporting entity’s production target is based on its current expectation of future results or events, and should not be solely relied upon by investors when making investment decisions.”

Guidance

Any statement about a Production Target will be deemed to be misleading unless the person making the statement has reasonable grounds for making the statement. The Regulator considers that it is only under exceptional circumstances that a Mining Reporting Entity might form a view that it has reasonable grounds for a Production Target to be wholly based on Inferred Mineral Resources.

(1)

references the earlier disclosure that was in compliance with Rule 11.8.3;

(2)

contains a statement confirming that all the material assumptions in the initial disclosure, upon which the Production Target is based continue to apply and have not materially changed;
