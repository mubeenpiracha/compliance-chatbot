Guidance

The Regulator would consider that a document has been made available to the public if, following its Disclosure, the document is available on the Listed Entity's website or on the website of the Recognised Investment Exchange on which its Securities are admitted to trading.

Contact details

2.8.6 A Reporting Listed Entity must ensure that the Regulator is provided with up to date contact details of appropriate persons nominated by it to act as the first point of contact with the Regulator in relation to the Listed Entity's compliance with the Rules and FSMR, as applicable.

Guidance

The Regulator would expect a Reporting Entity's contact in Rule 2.8.6 to be of sufficient seniority and influence given the nature of the information which such Person would be dealing with and the importance of the role in maintaining the Listed Entity's compliance with the Rules and FSMR.

3.3

Prospectus requirements relating to a Listed Fund

Guidance

1.

The Prospectus requirements including content and structure in chapter 4 of this Rulebook do not apply to Prospectuses relating to Units of Funds. Prospectus requirements that apply to an Offer of Units of Funds are found in the Fund Rules. Section 57(1) of FSMR disapplies chapter 4 of this Rulebook to Fund Prospectuses.

2.

However a Prospectus is required for the purposes of admitting any Financial Instruments, including Units, to trading on a Recognised Investment Exchange, as these fall within the definition of "Securities" for the purposes of Part 6 of FSMR. The Rules in this Rule 3.3 are designed to enable a Person seeking to have Units of a Fund admitted to trading on a Recognised Investment Exchange to be able to use a Prospectus prepared in accordance with the requirements in the Fund Rules if it is a Domestic Fund. In the case of Foreign Funds, the Offer documents or admission to trading documents prepared in accordance with the requirements in a foreign jurisdiction will be acceptable in the circumstances prescribed in this section.

3.3.1

A Person intending to have Units admitted to trading on a Recognised Investment Exchange must, subject to (2),
