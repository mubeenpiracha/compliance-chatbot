Guidance

This requirement applies to disclosures containing Exploration Results under Rule 11.4 or any original or updated estimates of Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves under Rules 11.5 or 11.6. For the requirement relating to the Summary of Reserves and Resources, refer to Rule 11.11.

11.12.3 Rule 11.12.1 only applies the first time a Mining Reporting Entity discloses Exploration Results in accordance with Rule 11.4 or original or updated estimates of Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves in accordance with Rules 11.5 or 11.6 provided that:

(1) any subsequent disclosure that refers to those Exploration Results or estimates of Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves references the earlier disclosure that was in compliance with Rule 11.12.1; and

(2)

the Mining Reporting Entity confirms in the subsequent disclosure that it is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects the information included in the earlier disclosure(s) and, in the case of estimates of Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves, that all material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the estimates in the earlier disclosure(s) continue to apply and have not materially changed.
