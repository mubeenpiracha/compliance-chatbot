Guidance

In the case of a Listed Fund, the Reporting Entity is the Fund Manager. However, as the Governing Body of a Listed Fund may include other persons who exercise powers similar to those that are exercised by Directors of the Fund Manager, the obligations relating to disclosure of material interests extend, in the case of a Listed Fund, to members of its Governing Body.
