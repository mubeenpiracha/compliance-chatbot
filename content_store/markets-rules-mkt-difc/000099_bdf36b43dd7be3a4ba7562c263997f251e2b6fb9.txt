Guidance

1.

The Corporate Governance Principles in this section apply to Reporting Entities as mandatory high level requirements. App4 sets out best practice standards that may be adopted by a Reporting Entity to achieve compliance with these principles.

2.

The best practice standards in App4 are designed to provide a degree of flexibility so that a Reporting Entity can achieve outcomes intended by the Corporate Governance Principles whilst taking into account the nature, scale and complexity of its business.

3.

Generally, if a Reporting Entity does not adopt the best practice standards set out in App4, or adopts them only partially, the DFSA would expect the reasons for doing so and any alternative measures adopted to achieve the outcomes intended by the Corporate Governance Principles to be disclosed in the Prospectus and thereafter pursuant to disclosure required under Rule 3.2.10. Any inaccurate or false representations would breach the prohibition against misleading and deceptive statements in Article 20 of the Law.
