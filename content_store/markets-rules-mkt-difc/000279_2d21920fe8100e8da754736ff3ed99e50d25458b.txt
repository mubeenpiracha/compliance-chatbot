For the purposes of Rule 9.3.3, the DFSA considers “present requirements” to be a minimum period of 12 months from date of listing.

2.

Rule 1.4 of Appendix 1.2.1 requires the Directors of an Issuer in its Prospectus to make a statement that it has sufficient working capital for its present requirements i.e. a “clean” working capital statement. If an Applicant is unable to make a clean working capital statement, the Applicant would need to make a statement that it does not have sufficient working capital and explain how additional working capital will be provided.
