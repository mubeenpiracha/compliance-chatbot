The DFSAâ€™s Policy Statement 2/2012 on Appointment of Compliance Adviser describes in greater detail the purpose of a compliance adviser and the circumstances in which the DFSA is likely to require a Reporting Entity to appoint a compliance adviser. The Policy also describes how a compliance adviser can assist a Reporting Entity to meet its obligations in the Law and this module generally, and specifically the continuing obligations prescribed in this section. The Policy explains that the compliance adviser does not take on any regulatory obligations or potential regulatory liability of its own under the Law or this module if it agrees to act as a compliance adviser to a Reporting Entity. The relationship between the Reporting Entity and compliance adviser is a contractual one similar to one with any other professional adviser. In the Policy Statement the DFSA confirms its view that the compliance adviser role is merely to advise and assist the Reporting Entity to comply with its continuing regulatory responsibilities, all of which remain the responsibility of the Reporting Entity.
