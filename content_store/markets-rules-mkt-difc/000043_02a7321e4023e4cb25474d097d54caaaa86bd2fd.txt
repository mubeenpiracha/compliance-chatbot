2.2 Exempt communications

Guidance

Exempt Communications are not Offers of Securities to the Public and therefore do not attract the Prospectus requirements in the Law and Rules.

2.2.1 For the purposes of Article 12(c) of the Law, in addition to the Exempt Communications specified in the Law, a communication is hereby prescribed by the DFSA as an Exempt Communication if it is made:

(a)

in connection with the trading of Securities that are listed and traded on a Regulated Exchange, or the trading of Security Tokens that are traded on an Alternative Trading System; and

(b)

in the ordinary course of business of an Authorised Firm or Recognised Member.
