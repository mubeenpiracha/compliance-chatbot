The annual report required under Rule 3.2.10 must include a statement by the Board of Directors (the “Board”), stating whether or not, in its opinion, the corporate governance framework of the Reporting Entity is effective in achieving the outcome required by Article 39(1) and promoting compliance with the Principles, with supporting information and assumptions, and qualifications if necessary. As the Principles are the core of the corporate governance framework, the way in which they are applied should be the central question for the Board as it determines how the Reporting Entity conducts its affairs under its directorship in accordance with the letter and spirit of the applicable requirements including the Principles and the standards.
