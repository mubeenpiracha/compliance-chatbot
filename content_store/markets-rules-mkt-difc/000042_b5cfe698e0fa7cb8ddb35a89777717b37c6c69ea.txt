The DFSA has the power, pursuant to Article 12(1) of the Law, to prescribe certain communications to be Exempt Communications. Such communications are not subject to the prohibition in Article 14(1) of the Law as they fall outside the definition of an “Offer of Securities to the Public” in Article 12(1) of the Law.
