Guidance

1.

The DFSA may modify or waive Rule 9.3.2, if it is satisfied that it is desirable in the interests of investors and that investors have the necessary information available to arrive at an informed judgement about the Issuer and the Shares for which a Listing is sought.

2.

The DFSA would accept a shorter period than three years for an applicant that is not a SME, depending on the nature of the Applicantâ€™s business and any other material considerations, for example, where the Issuer has been in operation for less than 3 years.

Working capital

9.3.3 An Applicant seeking admission of Shares to the List must satisfy the DFSA that it and any Subsidiaries have sufficient working capital available for its present requirements or, if not, how it proposes to provide the additional working capital needed.
