The DFSAâ€™s Policy Statement 1/2012 on Appointment of a Sponsor describes in greater detail the role and regulatory obligations of a sponsor and the kind of knowledge, experience, qualifications and resources the DFSA expects a sponsor to have. The Policy explains that although a sponsor has certain regulatory obligations of its own, as prescribed in this module, its principal role is to assist a Person making a Prospectus Offer to comply with its regulatory responsibilities relating to that offer. In the Policy Statement, the DFSA confirms that a Person making a Prospectus Offer does not, and cannot, avoid or diminish its regulatory obligations related to Offering Securities simply because it is required to have a sponsor. The regulatory obligations of the Person making the Prospectus Offer are not transferred to the sponsor but remain the responsibility of the Person making the offer.
