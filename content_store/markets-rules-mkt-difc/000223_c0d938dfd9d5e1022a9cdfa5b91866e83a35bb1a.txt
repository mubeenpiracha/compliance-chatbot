(4) Where a Reporting Entity makes selective disclosure of Inside Information pursuant to (1), it must ensure that a full announcement is made to the market as soon as possible, and in any event, when it becomes aware or has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information has or may have come to the knowledge of any Person or Persons other than those to whom the selective disclosure was made.

Guidance

1.

It is likely that Inside Information will be made known to certain Employees of the Reporting Entity or the Listed Fund. A Reporting Entity should put in place procedures to ensure that those Employees do not disclose such information, whether or not inadvertently, and that Employees are adequately trained in the identification and handling of Inside Information.

2.

Rule 6.5.3 does not excuse a Reporting Entity from its overriding obligation to disclose Inside Information as soon as possible pursuant to Rule 6.5.1. A Reporting Entity which proposes to delay public disclosure of Inside Information should refer to Rule 6.5.4, which sets out the limited disclosure exceptions permitted.
