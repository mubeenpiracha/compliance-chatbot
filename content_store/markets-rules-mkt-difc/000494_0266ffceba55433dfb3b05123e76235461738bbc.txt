Chairman and chief executive

16.

In order to ensure that the Boardâ€™s function of providing effective oversight of the management of the Reporting Entity is not compromised, it is important that the role of the chairman of the Board and the role of the chief executive of the Reporting Entity should not be held by the same individual.

17. However, if the Board decides that the chief executive should also hold the position of the chairman of the Board, there should be effective measures to ensure that the Board is able to properly discharge its function of providing effective oversight of the management of the business of the Reporting Entity by its Senior Management. For example, the performance assessment of the chief executive and other members of the Senior Management should be undertaken by a non-executive Director of the Board (such as the senior independent Director) or a committee comprising a majority of non-executive Directors who report to the Board directly on their assessment, and also, prior approval by shareholders of the appointment of the chief executive as chairman of the Board.
