Guidance

1.

The market disclosure requirements applicable to Listed Funds and ATS Traded Funds are in chapter 6.

2.

This chapter sets out the obligations of Reporting Entities to disclose and control information in order to protect actual and potential investors and to maintain a fair, informed and orderly market in Securities. This chapter also sets out the limited circumstances under which a Reporting Entity may selectively disclose Inside Information, delay public disclosure and control access to such information in order to limit the potential market abuse.

3.

The DFSA recognises the importance to the market of accurate, up-to-date information about Reporting Entities. Reporting Entities are therefore required to disseminate Inside Information as soon as possible. Where these obligations are not met and the DFSA considers it appropriate, the DFSA may seek one or more sanctions as specified in Part 7 of the Law.
