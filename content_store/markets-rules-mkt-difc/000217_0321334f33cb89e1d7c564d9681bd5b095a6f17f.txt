Relationship between continuous disclosure and periodic disclosures

12.

Periodic disclosures by Reporting Entities of Listed Funds are required in a number of circumstances, and examples can include interim and annual financial reports and accounts and Prospectuses.

13.

In the course of preparing these disclosure documents, a Reporting Entity of a Listed Fund may become aware of Inside Information previously unknown to it, or information which was previously insufficiently precise to warrant disclosure. In such circumstances a Reporting Entity of a Listed Fund should not defer releasing that information until the periodic disclosure or other documents is finalised. In such circumstances, a Reporting Entity should make an announcement containing the Inside Information as soon as possible.
