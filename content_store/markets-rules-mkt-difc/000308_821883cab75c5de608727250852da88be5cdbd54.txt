Guidance

In Rule 9.6.6(b), an example of a breach of the continuing obligations which may warrant a delisting by the DFSA would be where the percentage of shares in public hands falls below 25% or such lower percentage as the DFSA may permit. The DFSA may, however, allow a reasonable time to restore the percentage unless this is precluded by the need to maintain the smooth operation of the market or to protect investors.
