Market disclosure – chapter 4

3.

Every Reporting Entity is required to disclose to the market certain types of information either relating to the Securities of the Reporting Entity or the Reporting Entity itself. Such disclosure is designed to ensure that the markets are continually updated with information that is likely to have an impact on the price of the Securities so that investors can make an informed judgement about those Securities. For this purpose, Chapter 4 requires disclosure of Inside Information, with carve-outs for non-disclosure of commercially sensitive information for a limited period, as well as disclosures of interests held by Persons in positions of control or influence relating to a Reporting Entity (such as controllers and their associates, called “Connected Persons”), and the disclosure of Directors’ material interests in the Reporting Entity. The means by which disclosure of the information required to be provided to the markets are also specified in this chapter.
