57. Whilst recognising that most shareholder contact is with the chief executive and finance Director, the chairman and other Directors, including non-executive Directors, as appropriate should maintain sufficient contact with major shareholders to understand their issues and concerns. The Board should keep in touch with shareholder opinion using means which are most practical and efficient taking into account the nature, scale and complexity of its operations and the nature of its shareholder base. The Board should use its website as a forum for the posting of information such as new strategies, calendar for important meetings and other events.

58. The chairman should ensure that the views of shareholders are communicated to the Board as a whole. In addition, the chairman should discuss governance and strategy of the Reporting Entity at least with its major shareholders. Non-executive Directors should be offered the opportunity to attend meetings with major shareholders and should expect to attend such meetings especially if requested by major shareholders.
