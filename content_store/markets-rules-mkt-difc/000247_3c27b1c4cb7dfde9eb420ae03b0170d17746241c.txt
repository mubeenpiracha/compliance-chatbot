Guidance

1.

The DFSA may require the appointment of a sponsor, or third party certification in respect of any matters relating to an Issuer, in appropriate cases. An example of circumstances in which the DFSA may require the appointment of a sponsor, or third party signoff, would be where an Issuer does not have a proven track record, such as a start-up.

2.

The DFSA will generally not require a SME to appoint a sponsor, as to do so is likely to be disproportionate given the nature, scale and resources of a SME. Instead, the DFSA will usually require a SME to appoint a compliance adviser under Article 49(1) of the Law and Section 7.2, both when it applies for admission of its Shares to the List and on an ongoing basis once its Shares are admitted to the List.
