Many requirements designed to ensure sound corporate governance of companies, such as those relating to shareholder and minority protection and responsibilities of the Board of Directors of companies, are found in the company laws and apply to Authorised Persons. Additional disclosure requirements also apply if they are listed companies. The requirements in this Rulebook are tailored to Authorised Persons and are designed to augment and not to exclude the application of those requirements.

Whilst Rule 3.3.41 deals with two aspects of corporate governance, the requirements included in other provisions under Rules 3.2 and 3.3 also go to the heart of sound corporate governance by promoting prudent and sound management of the Authorised Personâ€™s business in the interest of its Customers and stakeholders. These requirements together are designed to promote sound corporate governance practices in Authorised Persons whilst also providing a greater degree of flexibility for Authorised Persons in establishing and implementing a corporate governance framework that are both appropriate and practicable to suit their operations.
