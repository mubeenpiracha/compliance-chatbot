Guidance

1.

Under Rule 9.1.1(2), the principles apply, unless otherwise stated, only to the Representative Office in ADGM and not to the institution as a whole.

2.

The Principles for Representative Offices have the status of Rules and are a general statement of fundamental regulatory requirements which apply alongside the other Rules including in relation to new or unforeseen situations which may not be covered elsewhere by a specific Rule. Rules in other areas of this Rulebook build upon these fundamental principles. Consequently the Rules and Guidance elsewhere should not be seen as exhausting the implications of the Principles.

3.

Breaching a Principle for Representative Offices makes a Representative Office liable to disciplinary action, and may indicate that it is no longer fit and proper to carry on a Regulated Activity or to hold a Financial Services Permission. The Regulator may consider withdrawing the Financial Services Permission on that basis.

4.

The onus will be on the Regulator to show that the Representative Office has been at fault in some way, taking into account the standard of conduct required under the Principle in question.
