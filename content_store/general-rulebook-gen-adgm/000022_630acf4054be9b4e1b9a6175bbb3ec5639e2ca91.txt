Guidance

1.

The Principles for Approved Persons do not apply to an Approved Person in respect of any other functions they may carry out, although their conduct in those functions may be relevant to their fitness and propriety.

2.

Breaching a Principle for Approved Persons may indicate that an Approved Person is no longer fit and proper to perform a Controlled Function. The Regulator may consider suspending or withdrawing Approved Person status on that basis.

3.

In those circumstances, the onus is on the Regulator to show that the Approved Person is culpable, taking into account the standard of conduct required under the Principle in question. In determining whether or not the particular conduct of an Approved Person complies with the Principles for Approved Persons, the Regulator will take account of whether that conduct is consistent with the requirements and standards relevant to their Authorised Person, their own role and the information available to them.
