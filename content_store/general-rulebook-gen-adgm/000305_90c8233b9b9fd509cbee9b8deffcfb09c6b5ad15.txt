The Governing Body should have appropriate practices and procedures for its own internal governance, and ensure that these are followed, and periodically reviewed to ensure their effectiveness and adequacy. These policies and procedures should cover a formal and transparent process for nomination, selection, and removal of the members of the Governing Body (see the GPM), and a specified term of office as appropriate to the roles and responsibilities of the member, particularly to ensure the objectivity of their decision making and judgment (see paragraph 11 of this Appendix). Appropriate succession planning should also form part of the Governing Body's internal governance practices.
