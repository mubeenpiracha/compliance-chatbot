As part of its monitoring, the Regulator expects an Authorised Person to regularly review system logs, warnings, errors and security events to identify suspicious activities and system errors indicating a potential Cyber Incident.

3.

The process for escalating actual or potential Cyber Incidents should define a point of contact for reporting incidents. All Employees should be made aware of their responsibility to report actual or potential Cyber Incidents as quickly as possible.
