Defined Terms

9.

Defined terms are identified throughout the Rulebook by the capitalisation of the initial letter of a word or of each word in a phrase and are defined in GLO, however, where a word or phrase is used only in a prudential context in PRU then for convenience purposes it is also defined under Rule 1.2.1 of PRU. Unless the context otherwise requires, where capitalisation of the initial letter is not used, an expression has its natural meaning.
