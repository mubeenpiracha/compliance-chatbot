For example, an Authorised Person which is a small scale operation with a tightly held ownership structure may not be able to constitute a Governing Body which comprises members who are fully independent of the Authorised Person's business and from each other, nor be sufficiently large to be able to form numerous committees of the Governing Body to undertake various functions such as nomination and Remuneration. Similarly, it may not be necessary for a Bank or Insurer to have a majority of Non-Executive Directors, or an Independent Non-Executive Director, appointed to its Governing Body where it is a Subsidiary or at an early stage of its operations. If that is the case, the Authorised Person should apply for a waiver or modification of the relevant requirements in Rule 3.3.41A, providing appropriate justification.
