Guidance

1.

Each Authorised Person and Recognised Body should consider whether there is any financial or personal relationship between it or any of its relevant Employees and the Auditor or any of the relevant Employees of the Auditor that may affect the judgement of the Auditor when conducting an audit of the Authorised Person or Recognised Body or complying with all its legal obligations, including FSMR, AML and other relevant Rulebooks.

2.

Each Authorised Person and Recognised Body should consider rotating the appointed relevant staff of the Auditor on a regular basis to ensure that the relevant staff of the Auditor remain independent.

If requested by the Regulator, an Authorised Person or Recognised Body which carries on Regulated Activities through a Branch must provide the Regulator with information on its appointed or proposed Auditor with regard to the Auditor's skills, experience and independence.
