Guidance

Other avenues for resolution of a Complaint may include an external dispute resolution scheme, arbitration, the Appeals Panel or Court in ADGM.

Employees handling Complaints

Where appropriate, taking into account the nature, scale and complexity of an Authorised Person's business, an Authorised Person must ensure that any individual handling the Complaint is not or was not involved in the conduct of the Regulated Activity about which the Complaint has been made, and is able to handle the Complaint in a fair and impartial manner.

An Authorised Person must ensure that any individual responsible for handling the Complaint has sufficient authority to resolve the Complaint or has access to individuals with the necessary authority.
