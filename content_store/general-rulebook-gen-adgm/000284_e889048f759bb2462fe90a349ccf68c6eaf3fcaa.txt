A Representative Office applying to change the scope of its Financial Services Permission, or to have a condition or restriction varied or withdrawn, must provide the Regulator with written details of the proposed changes.

Guidance

A Representative Office applying to change the scope of its Financial Services Permission should bear in mind that it may have to change its legal structure. The process will involve a fundamental review of the Representative Office by the Regulator to ascertain whether the Representative Office meets all the relevant criteria to enable the proposed change in scope of its Financial Services Permission.

For the purposes of IFR and Schedule 1 of FSMR, a Representative Office will not be taken to be holding itself out as conducting Islamic Financial Business in or from ADGM in circumstances where it:

(1)

does not represent that it provides, in or from ADGM, any services that are in accordance with Shariâ€™a; and

(2)

acts within the scope of its Financial Services Permission, that is, it does not carry on in or from ADGM a Regulated Activity other than Operating a Representative Office.
