Guidance

This Rule supplements the overarching requirements that govern the outsourcing of functions and activities under Rules 3.3.31 and 3.3.32 and PRU 6.8.1 by an Authorised Person. The scope of this Rule is wider than the scope of

GEN VER11.290725

those outsourcing requirements as it applies to the provision of all ICT Services, including the provision of cloud services and the maintenance of the servers of an Authorised Person.

2.

The supervision of the provision of ICT Services by a third party under Rule 3.5.2(1)(c) should include regular verification that the third party complies with appropriate security requirements. Verification may be achieved through a review of the third partyâ€™s control environment that the third party or Authorised Person conducts, through provision of independent audit reports or through other suitable means. The frequency, scope and nature of the verification should be determined based on the criticality of systems and the sensitivity of information contained in them. In certain circumstances, it may not be appropriate to allow the third party to undertake such review or verification itself.
