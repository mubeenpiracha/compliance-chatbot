Notwithstanding this Rule, an Authorised Person would generally be expected to separate the roles of Compliance Officer and Senior Executive Officer. In addition, the roles of Compliance Officer, Finance Officer and Money Laundering Reporting Officer would not be expected to be combined with any other Controlled Functions unless appropriate monitoring and control arrangements independent of the individual concerned will be implemented by the Authorised Person. This may be possible in the case of a Branch, where monitoring and controlling of the individual (carrying out more than one role in the Branch) is conducted from the Authorised Person's home state by an appropriate individual for each of the relevant Controlled Functions as applicable. However, it is recognised that, on a case by case basis, there may be exceptional circumstances in which this may not always be practical or possible.
