a.

the overall Remuneration structure contains an appropriate mix of fixed and variable components. For example, if the fixed component of Remuneration of an Employee is very small relative to the variable (e.g. bonus) component, it may become difficult for the Authorised Person or Recognised Body to reduce or eliminate bonuses even in a poor performing financial year;

b.

there are clear and objective criteria for allocating performance based Remuneration (see below in Guidance point 8);

c.

there are appropriate adjustments for the material 'current' and 'future' risks associated with the performance of the relevant Employee, as the time horizon in which risks could manifest themselves may vary. For example, where practicable, the measurement of performance should be set in a multi-year framework. If this is not practicable, there should be deferral of vesting of the benefits or retention or claw-back arrangements applicable to such components as appropriate;
