GEN VER11.290725

Guidance

1.

The Regulator expects the Governing Body of an Authorised Person to demonstrate a thorough understanding of all Cyber Risk to which it is or might be exposed. The Governing Body should be regularly updated on current global cyber trends and be included in Cyber Risk training, cyber awareness campaigns and similar activities conducted by the Authorised Person.

2. Management information on Cyber Risk and mitigation measures should be presented to the Governing Body in a way that can be easily understood and analysed. It should include information on current and emerging Cyber Risks and the efficacy of existing mitigation measures. For example, the Regulator expects the Governing Body to be informed when the Authorised Person is exposed to Cyber Risk approaching the Authorised Personâ€™s risk tolerance in that area.
