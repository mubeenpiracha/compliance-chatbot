(b)

issue to the applicant, and where appropriate to the Authorised Person, an approval notice as soon as practicable after making that decision.

(2)

An approval pursuant to Rule 8.8.5(3)(a), including a conditional approval granted by the Regulator pursuant to Rule 8.8.5(3)(b), is valid for a period of one year from the date of the approval, unless an extension is granted by the Regulator in writing.

Guidance

1.

If the application for approval lodged with the Regulator does not contain all the required information, then the 90 day period runs from the date on which all the relevant information has been provided to the Regulator.

2.

If a Person who has obtained prior Regulator approval for an acquisition or an increase in the control of an Authorised Person is unable to effect the acquisition before the end of the period referred to in Rule 8.8.6(2), it will need to obtain fresh approval from the Regulator.
