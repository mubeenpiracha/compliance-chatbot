Best practice relating to corporate governance

11.

In addition to the considerations noted above, best practice that an Authorised Person may adopt to achieve compliance with the applicable corporate governance standards is set out in Guidance at Appendix 1.1. An Authorised Person may, where the best practice set out in Appendix 1.1 is not suited to its particular business or structure, deviate from such best practice or any aspects thereof. The Regulator will expect the Authorised Person to demonstrate to the Regulator, upon request, what the deviations are and why such deviations are considered by the Authorised Person to be appropriate. An Authorised Person should periodically undertake a review of its corporate governance, and its effectiveness against best practice. The Regulator may request a copy of the output of such periodic reviews.
