An example of an Employee providing Regulated Activities to a Customer is a client relationship manager employed by an Authorised Person providing wealth management services. In contrast, an Employee who may be employed in the back office of an Authorised Person with responsibility for setting up Client Accounts would not be client facing.

An Authorised Person must ensure that key duties and functions are segregated. Such segregation must ensure that the duties and functions to be performed by the same individual do not conflict with each other, thereby impairing the effective discharge of those functions by the relevant individuals (such as undetected errors or any abuse of positions) and thus exposing the Authorised Person or its Customers or users to inappropriate risks.
