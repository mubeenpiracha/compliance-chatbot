Who should be covered by Remuneration policy

4.

An Authorised Person or Recognised Body's Remuneration policy should, at a minimum, cover those specified in Rule 3.3.42(1)(c). Accordingly, the members of the Governing Body, the senior management, the Persons Undertaking Key Control Functions and any Major Risk-Taking Employees should be included in the Authorised Person or Recognised Body's Remuneration policy. With the exception of the 'senior management', all the other three categories attract their own definitions. Although the expression "senior management" carries its natural meaning, Rule 3.3.41(3) describes the senior management's role as the "day-to-day management of the Authorised Person or Recognised Body's businessâ€¦". Guidance point 3 under Rule 3.3.3 gives further clarification as to who may perform senior management functions.
