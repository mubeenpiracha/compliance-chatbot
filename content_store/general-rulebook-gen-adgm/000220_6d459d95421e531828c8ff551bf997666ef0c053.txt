8.8

Changes relating to control

(1)

This Rule applies, subject to (2) and (3), to:

(a)

an Authorised Person or Recognised Body; or

(b)

a Person who is, or is proposing to become, a Controller specified in Rule 8.8.2.

(2)

This Chapter does not apply to a Representative Office or a Person who is a Controller of such a Representative Office.

(3)

A Credit Rating Agency must comply with the requirements in this Rule as if it were a non-ADGM established company.

Guidance

The requirements in respect of notification of changes relating to control of Branches (i.e. non-ADGM established companies) are set out in Rule 8.8.10. Although some Credit Rating Agencies may be companies established in ADGM, such companies will only be subject to the notification requirements relating to their Controllers. Accordingly, regardless of whether a Credit Rating Agency is a company established in ADGM or a Branch operation, it is subject to the notification requirements only and not to the requirement for prior approval by the Regulator of changes relating to its Controllers.
