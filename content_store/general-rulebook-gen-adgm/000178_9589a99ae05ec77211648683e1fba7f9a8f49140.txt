(2)

give the Auditor right of access at all reasonable times to relevant records and information within its possession;

(3)

allow the Auditor to make copies of any records or information referred to in (2);

(4)

do not interfere with the Auditor's ability to discharge its duties;

report to the Auditor any matter which may significantly affect the financial position of the Authorised Person or Recognised Body; and
