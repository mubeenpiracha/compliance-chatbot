Guidance

1.

There are two formulations of RC depending on whether the transactions with a Counterparty are unmargined or margined.

2.

For unmargined transactions the RC intends to capture the loss that would occur if a Counterparty were to default and were closed out of its transactions immediately. For margined transactions the RC intends to capture the loss that would occur if a counterparty were to default at the present or at a future time, assuming that the close-out and replacement of transactions occur instantaneously.

3.

In both cases, the haircut applicable to non-cash Collateral in the RC formulation represents the potential change in value of the Collateral during the appropriate time period (one year for unmargined transactions and the MPoR for margined transactions).

4.

To calculate the net Collateral amount under Rule A4.8.3(3), an Authorised Firm should account Collateral received with a positive sign and the amount posted with a negative sign.
