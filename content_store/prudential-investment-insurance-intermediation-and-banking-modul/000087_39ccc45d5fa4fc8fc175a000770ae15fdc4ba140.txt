Category 2

An Authorised Firm is in Category 2 if:

(a)

its Licence authorises it to carry on one or more of the Financial Services of Providing Credit or Dealing in Investments as Principal; and

(b)

it does not meet the criteria of Categories 1 or 5.

Guidance

A Category 2 Authorised Firm may be authorised to conduct other Financial Services, but it is the authorisation for Dealing in Investments as Principal or authorisation for Providing Credit, and the absence of authorisation for the activities specified in Rule 1.3.1, that are determinative of its belonging to Category 2.
