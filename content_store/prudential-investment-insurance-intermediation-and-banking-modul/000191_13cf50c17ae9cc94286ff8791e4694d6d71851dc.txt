SFCOM =

the supervisory factor for the commodities asset class, determined in accordance with the table in Rule A4.8.18

EffNotj

COM =

the effective notional amount of hedging set ‘j’, calculated in accordance with Rule (3)

j =

the index that denotes all hedging sets of the commodities asset class, formed in accordance with Rule A4.8.5

(3) For the purpose of (2), an Authorised Firm must calculate the effective notional

amount’ of hedging set ‘j’, denoted by EffNotj

COM, using the following formula:

𝐄𝐟𝐟𝐍𝐨𝐭𝐣

𝐂𝐎𝐌 = ∑ 𝛅𝐢 ∙ 𝐀𝐝𝐣𝐍𝐨𝐭𝐢

𝐂𝐎𝐌 ∙ 𝐌𝐅𝐢

𝐢∈𝐈(𝐣)

where:

I(j) =

the set of all transactions belonging to hedging set ‘j’

δi =

the supervisory delta for the transaction ‘i’, determined in accordance with the table in Rule A4.8.18

MFi =

the maturity factor of the transaction ‘i’, calculated in accordance with Rule A4.8.15

AdjNoti

COM =

the adjusted notional amount for transaction ‘i’, calculated in accordance with Rule A4.8.13

Guidance

The calculation of the add-on for the commodity asset class is similar to the calculation of the add-on for the credit and equity asset classes. It recognises the full offsetting of long and short positions for derivatives that reference the same type of underlying commodity. It also allows partial offsetting between derivatives that reference different types of commodities, however, this partial offsetting is only permitted within each of the four hedging sets of the commodity asset class, where the different commodity types are more likely to demonstrate some stable, meaningful joint dynamics. Offsetting between hedging sets is not recognised (eg a forward contract on crude oil cannot hedge a forward contract on corn).

Supervisory delta

A4.8.12 For the purpose of Rules A4.8.7 to A4.8.11, an Authorised Firm must determine the

supervisory delta, δ, as follows:

(a)

for transactions that are not options or collateralised debt obligations the supervisory delta must be determined in accordance with the table below:

Transaction is a long position in the primary risk factor

Transaction is a short position in the primary risk factor

for the purpose of (a), a transaction is:

(i)

a long position in the primary risk factor if the market value of the transaction increases when the risk factor increases; and

(ii)

a short position in the primary risk factor if the market value of the transaction decreases when the risk factor increases;

for options the supervisory delta must be calculated using the applicable formula in the table below:
