Guidance

Senior management and the Governing Body of an Authorised Firm are expected to demonstrate a thorough understanding of the links between funding liquidity risk and market liquidity risk, as well as how other risks, including credit, market, operational and reputation risks, affect the Authorised Firmâ€™s overall Liquidity Risk policy.

2.

Senior management should ensure that all business units with activities that have an impact on Liquidity Risk are aware of the Liquidity Risk policy and limits.
