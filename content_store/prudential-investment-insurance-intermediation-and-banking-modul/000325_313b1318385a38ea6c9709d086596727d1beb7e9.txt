An Authorised Firm must use either the:

(a)

Financial Collateral Simplified Approach (FCSA) which adopts the treatment under Rule 4.13.5 in relation to the composition of financial Collateral; or

(b)

Financial Collateral Comprehensive Approach (FCCA) which adopts the treatment under Rule 4.13.6;

to recognise the effect of eligible financial Collateral.

(3)

An Authorised Firm must apply the chosen approach consistently to its entire Non-Trading Book and must not use a combination of both approaches.

An Authorised Firm using the FCSA may recognise the effect of eligible financial Collateral in accordance with the Rules in section 4.13.

An Authorised Firm using the FCCA may calculate the CR Exposure adjusted for eligible financial Collateral (referred to in PIB as “E*”), in accordance with Rules in section A4.3 of App4 and substitute E* for E when calculating the Credit Risk- weighted Exposure amount for that CR Exposure under section 4.8.
