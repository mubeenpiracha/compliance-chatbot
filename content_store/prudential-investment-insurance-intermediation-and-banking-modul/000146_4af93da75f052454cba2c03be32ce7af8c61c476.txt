 to meet its liquidity needs for, at a minimum, a 30 calendar day period under a severe stress scenario.

Guidance

Rules A9.2.2 to A9.2.9 in App9 set out the conditions that must be met for assets to be treated as HQLA.

Liquidity Coverage Ratio

An Authorised Firm must, except as provided in Rule 9.3.8, maintain a LCR of at least the level specified in the table below from the date specified in the table.

Guidance

Under Rule 9.3.4, an Authorised Firm must maintain a minimum level of LCR of 60% starting on 1 January 2015. The minimum requirement will be increased subsequently in each following year in equal annual steps of 10% to reach 100% on and from 1 January 2019. Rule 9.3.4 sets minimum levels and is not intended to limit the generality of the requirement in Rule 9.3.3.

An Authorised Firm must calculate its LCR using the following formula and in accordance with the Rules in section A9.2 of App9.

LCR =

Value of stock of HQLA Total Net Cash Outflows over the next 30 calendar days

Guidance

1.

Section A9.2 of App9 sets out how the value of stock of HQLA and Total Net Cash Outflows are to be calculated.

2.

An Authorised Firm active in multiple currencies should:

a. maintain HQLA consistent with the distribution of its liquidity needs by currency;

b.

assess its aggregate foreign currency liquidity needs and determine an acceptable level of currency mismatches; and

c.

undertake a separate analysis of its strategy for each currency in which it has material activities, considering potential constraints in times of stress.

Individual Liquidity Requirement

(1) The DFSA may by written notice to an Authorised Firm:

(a)

adjust the LCR Requirement or NSFR Requirement;

(b)

adjust requirements under section A9.2 of App9 for calculating the Authorised Firm’s stock of HQLA or the Total Net Cash Outflows, or under section A9.4 of App9 for calculating its ASF or RSF;

(c)

alter the calculation methodologies or parameters for the purposes of the LCR Requirement or NSFR Requirement;

(d)

disapply the LCR Requirement or NSFR Requirement; or

(e)

impose additional requirements based on the DFSA assessment of the Liquidity Risk exposure of that Authorised Firm.

(2)

If the DFSA amends a requirement under (1)(a), (b), (c) or (e), the Authorised Firm must comply with the requirement as amended. If the DFSA disapplies a requirement under (1)(d), the Authorised Firm need not comply with that requirement.

(3) The procedures in Schedule 3 to the Regulatory Law apply to a decision of the

DFSA under (1)(a),(b),(c) or (e).

(4)

If the DFSA decides to exercise its power under (1)(a),(b),(c) or (e), the Authorised Firm may refer the matter to the FMT for review.

Liquid assets buffer

(1) An Authorised Firm must, except as provided under Rule 9.3.8, maintain a buffer of HQLA over the minimum level of LCR required under its LCR Requirement, appropriate to the nature, scale and complexity of its operations and in line with its Liquidity Risk tolerance.

(2)

In determining the size of its buffer of HQLA under (1), an Authorised Firm must also take into account the results of stress tests conducted under
