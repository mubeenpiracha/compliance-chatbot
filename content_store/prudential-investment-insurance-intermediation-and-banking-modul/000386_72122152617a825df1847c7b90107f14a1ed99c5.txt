1.

The primary source of the cash flows generated by a property are generally lease or rental payments or the sale of the property. The distinguishing characteristic of these Exposures compared to other Regulatory Real Estate Exposures is that both the servicing of the loan and the prospects for recovery in the event of default depend materially on the cash flows generated by the property securing the Exposure.

2.

The DFSA expects that the material dependence condition would predominantly apply to loans to corporates, SMEs or SPVs, but is not restricted to those borrower types. As an example, a loan may be considered materially dependent if more than 50% of the income from the borrower used in the Authorised Firmâ€™s assessment of its ability to service the loan is from cash flows generated by the residential property.

4.12.23 (1) An Authorised Firm must, subject to (3), risk-weight any Regulatory Residential Real Estate Exposure that is not materially dependent on cash flows generated by the property in accordance with the following table.
