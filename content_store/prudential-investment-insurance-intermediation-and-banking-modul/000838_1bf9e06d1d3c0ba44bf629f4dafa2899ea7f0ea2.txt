74. Appropriate systems and controls for provisions vary with the nature, scale and complexity of the credit granted. An Authorised Firm for which the extension of credit is a substantial part of its business is expected to have greater regard to developing, implementing and documenting a provisioning policy than an Authorised Firm for which Credit Risk is incidental to the operation of its business. The DFSA recognises that the frequency with which an Authorised Firm reviews its provisioning policy once it has been established will vary from firm to firm. However, the DFSA expects an Authorised Firm to review its policy to ensure it remains appropriate for the business it undertakes and the economic environment in which it operates. The provisioning policy should be reviewed at least annually by the Governing Body.
