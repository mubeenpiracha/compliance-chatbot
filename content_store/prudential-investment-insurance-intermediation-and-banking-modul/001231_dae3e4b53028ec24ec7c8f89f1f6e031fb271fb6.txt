Cash Inflows

A9.2.16 (1) When considering its available cash inflows, an Authorised Firm may include contractual inflows from outstanding exposures only if they are fully performing and there is no reasonable basis to expect a default within the 30-day period. Contingent inflows are not included in total net cash inflows.

(2) Where an Authorised Firm is overly reliant on cash inflows from one or a limited number of wholesale counterparties, the DFSA may set an alternative limit on the level of cash inflows that can be included in the LCR.

A9.2.17 (1) The DFSA may allow an Authorised Firm to recognise as cash inflow, access to a parent entityâ€™s funds via a committed funding facility if the Authorised Firm is a subsidiary of a foreign bank. In such instances, the committed funding facility from the parent entity must meet both of the following criteria:

(a)

the facility must be an irrevocable commitment and must be appropriately documented; and

(b)

the facility must be quantified.
