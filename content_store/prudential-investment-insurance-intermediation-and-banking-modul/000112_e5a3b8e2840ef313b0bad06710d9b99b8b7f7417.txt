 mitigation is used against an Exposure, an Authorised Firm must reduce the value of the original Exposure and recognise an equal Exposure to the Credit Risk mitigation provider, except where:

(a)

a credit default swap is used; and

(b)

neither the reference entity, nor the credit default swap provider, is a Financial Institution,

(3) For the purposes of Exposure shifting under (2), the amount subject to shifting

is:

(a)

the value of the protected portion for an unfunded credit protection;

(b)

where the FCSA is used, the market value of the collateral; and

(c)

where the FCCA is used, the market value of the collateral adjusted by applying the standard supervisory haircuts to the FCCA.

4.15.13 An Authorised Firm intending to utilise any of the provisions contained in section 4.13 (Credit Risk mitigation) for the purposes of reducing Exposure values should have in place policies and procedures addressing the following:

(a)

risks arising from maturity mismatches between Exposures and any credit protection on those Exposures;

(b)

the Concentration Risk arising from the application of Credit Risk mitigation techniques, including indirect Large Exposures – for example to a single Issuer of Securities taken as Collateral; and

(c)

the conduct of stress testing on Credit Risk mitigation taken as Collateral.

4.15.14 Where an Authorised Firm has availed itself of the reductions to Exposure values as set out in A4.11 the Authorised Firm must calculate the Exposure as a percentage of its Tier 1 Capital on both a gross and net basis.

4.15.15 An Authorised Firm that avails itself of the reduction in its Exposure value through the application of Rule A4.11 must conduct periodic stress tests on its Exposures against the realisable value of any Collateral considered under with the FCSA or FCCA.

4.15.16 Where the value of the Collateral under the stress scenario is lower than the value applied under Rule 4.15.12 the lower value should be used when determining the Exposure value for the purposes of this section.

Guidance:

Such stress tests should include market value changes of underlying Collateral, risks relating to liquidity and realisation of such Collateral in stress scenarios. An assessment of the impact of any such changes on the Exposure value and the capital position of the Authorised Firm should be conducted. Stress testing of these positions should be conducted at least once a year.
