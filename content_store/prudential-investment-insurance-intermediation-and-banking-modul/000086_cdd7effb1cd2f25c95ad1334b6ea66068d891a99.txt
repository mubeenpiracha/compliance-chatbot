so). However, a Category 4 firm may only conduct any of the Financial Services listed under Category 4 for which it is authorised.

Category 1

An Authorised Firm is in Category 1 if:

(a)

its Licence authorises it to carry on one or more of the Financial Services of Accepting Deposits or Managing a PSIAu; and

(b)

it does not meet the criteria of Category 5.

Guidance

A Category 1 Authorised Firm may be authorised to conduct other Financial Services, but it is the authorisation for Accepting Deposits or Managing a PSIAu that is determinative of its belonging to Category 1.
