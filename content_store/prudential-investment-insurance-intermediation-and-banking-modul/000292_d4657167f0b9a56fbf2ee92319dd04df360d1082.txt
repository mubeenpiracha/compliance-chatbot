Credit procedures manual

An Authorised Firm must implement and maintain a documented credit procedures manual, which sets out the criteria and procedures for granting new credits, for approving extensions of existing credits and exceptions, for conducting periodic and independent reviews of credits granted and for maintaining the records for credits granted.

The credit procedures manual must establish:

(a)

sound, well-defined criteria for granting credit, including a thorough understanding of the borrower or Counterparty, the purpose and structure of the credit and its source of repayment;

(b)

well defined processes for approving new Exposures as well as renewing and refinancing existing Exposures;

(c)

effective credit administration processes, including continued analysis of a borrower’s ability and willingness to repay under the terms of the debt, monitoring of documentation, legal covenants, contractual requirements and Collateral;

(d)

effective processes for classification and grading of credit assets consistent with the nature, size and complexity of the Authorised Firm’s activities;
