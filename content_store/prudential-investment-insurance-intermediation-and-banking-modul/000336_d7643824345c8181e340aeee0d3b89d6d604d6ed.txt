(b)

if the obligor has an Issuer external credit assessment, use the Issuer assessment of the obligor only if the Exposure without an issue-specific assessment ranks pari passu with or is senior to any unsecured claim that is not subordinated to any other claim on the obligor; or

(c)

in all other cases, apply a risk weight equal to the higher of the risk weight that is applicable to an unrated Exposure and the risk weight associated with the external credit assessment, if any, of the obligor or another Exposure to the same obligor.

4.11.7 Where a CR Exposure is risk-weighted in accordance with Rules 4.11.6(a) or (b), an Authorised Firm may use a domestic currency external credit assessment only if the CR Exposure is denominated in that domestic currency.

4.11.8 An Authorised Firm may use an external credit assessment to risk weight a CR Exposure only if the external credit assessment has taken into account and reflects the entire amount of Credit Risk Exposure the Authorised Firm has with regard to all payments owed to it.
