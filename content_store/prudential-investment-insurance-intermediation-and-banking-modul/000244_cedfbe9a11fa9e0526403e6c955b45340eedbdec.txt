for the Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Capital Requirement Counterparty ‘C’ on a standalone basis, calculated in accordance with Rule A.5.10.5

ρ =

50%, the supervisory correlation parameter

C =

the index that denotes all counterparties for which the firm uses BA-CVA to calculate its Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Capital Requirement

A5.10.5 For the purposes of Rule A5.10.4, an Authorised Firm must calculate SCVAC, using

the following formula:

SCVAC =

1 α

RWC ∙ ∑MNS ∙ EADNS ∙ DFNS

NS

where:

RWC =

the risk weight for Counterparty ‘C’. Counterparty ‘C’ must be mapped to one of the risk weights based on a combination of sector and credit quality and determined in accordance with the table in Rule A5.10.6

NS =

the index that denotes all the netting sets with a given Counterparty

C =

the index that denotes all the Counterparties for which the firm uses BA- CVA its Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Capital Requirement

to calculate

MNS =

the effective maturity for the netting set NS calculated as the weighted average remaining maturity of the exposures, where M is at least one year and the notional amount of each exposure is used for weighting the maturity

EADNS =

the exposure at default (EAD) of the netting set NS with Counterparty ‘C’, calculated in the same manner as the Authorised Firm calculates it for determining its Counterparty Credit Risk Capital Requirement under Rule 4.8.7

DFNS =

the supervisory discount factor, calculated as follows:

1 − e−0.05∙MNS 0.05 ∙ MNS

α =

1.4

A5.10.6 For the purposes of Rule A5.10.5, an Authorised Firm must set the value of RWC in

A5.10.7 If an Authorised Firm uses one or more Eligible CVA Hedges to hedge CVA Risk it must calculate its Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Capital Requirement, using the following formula:

DSBA−CVA · Kfull

where:

DSBA−CVA = 0.65, the discount scalar

Kfull =

β ∙ Kreduced + (1− β) ∙ Khedged

where:

β =

0.25, the supervisory floor

Kreduced = calculated in accordance with Rule A5.10.8

A5.10.8 For the purposes of Rule A5.10.7, an Authorised Firm must calculate Kreduced, using
