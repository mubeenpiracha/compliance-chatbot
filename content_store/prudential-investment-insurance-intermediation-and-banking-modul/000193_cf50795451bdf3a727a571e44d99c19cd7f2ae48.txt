 pool of ‘m’ reference names for transaction ‘i’

Guidance

1.

The supervisory delta is used to ensure that the effective notional amounts take into account the direction of the trade, i.e. whether the trade is long or short, by having a positive or negative sign. It also takes into account whether the trade has a non-linear relationship with the underlying risk factor (which is the case for options and collateralised debt obligation tranches).

2.

To calculate the supervisory delta for options an Authorised Firm should use, whenever appropriate, the forward (rather than the spot) value of the underlying in order to account for the risk-free rate as well as for possible cash flows prior to the option expiry (such as dividends).

Adjusted notional amount

A4.8.13 For the purpose of Rules A4.8.7 to A4.8.11, an Authorised Firm must calculate the a, as follows:

adjusted notional amount, AdjNoti

(a)

for transactions allocated to the interest rate or credit asset class, the adjusted notional amount for transaction ‘i’ must be calculated using the following formula:

AdjNoti

IR,CR = Ni ∙ max{(

e−0.05∙Si − e−0.05∙Ei 0.05

);

10 OneBusinessYear

}

where:

Ni =

the notional amount of transaction ‘i’, converted to USD, using the exchange rate on the calculation date

Si =

the Start Date of transaction ‘i’

Ei =

the End Date of transaction ‘i’

(b)

for transactions allocated to the foreign exchange asset class, the adjusted notional amount for transaction ‘i’ must be set as the notional amount of the foreign currency leg of the transaction, converted to dollars; if both legs of the transaction are denominated in a foreign currency, the notional amount of each leg is converted to dollars and the adjusted notional amount must be set as the leg with the larger dollar value; and

(c)

for transactions allocated to the equity or commodity asset class, the adjusted notional amount for transaction ‘i’ must be calculated as the product of the current price of one unit of the stock or commodity and the number of units referenced by transaction ‘i’, except where transaction ‘i’ is an equity volatility transaction, in which case the adjusted notional amount must be calculated as the product of the underlying volatility or variance referenced by transaction ‘i’ and the contractual notional amount of transaction ‘i’.

A4.8.14 For the purpose of calculating the adjusted notional amount of transaction ‘i’ referred to in Rule A4.8.13, an Authorised Firm must determine the notional amount of transaction ‘i’, as follows:

(a)

if the notional amount of a transaction is specified by the contract and fixed until maturity, the notional amount is the one specified;

(b)

if the notional amount is expressed as a formula of market values, the current market values must be used to determine the notional amount;

(c)

for a transaction allocated to the interest rate or credit asset class that has variable notional amounts specified by the contract, such as an amortising and accreting swap, the notional amount is the time-weighted average notional amount over the remaining life of the transaction;

(d)

for a leveraged swap, the transaction must be converted to the notional of the equivalent unleveraged swap; and

(e)

for a transaction that has multiple exchanges of the principal, the notional amount is multiplied by the number of exchanges of principal in the transaction.

Maturity factor

A4.8.15 For the purpose of Rules A4.8.7 to A4.8.11, an Authorised Firm must calculate the

maturity factor, MFi, as follows:

(a)

for transactions included in an Unmargined Netting Set, the maturity factor must be calculated as follows:

MFi = √min (max(Mi;

10 OneBusinessYear

);1)

where:

Mi =

the period
