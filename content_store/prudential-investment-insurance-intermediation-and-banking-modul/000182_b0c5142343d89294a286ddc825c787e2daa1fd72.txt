Exposure value

A4.8.2 (1) An Authorised Firm must calculate the CCR Exposure value of a Netting Set using

the following formula:

Exposure value = α ∙ (RC + PFE)

where:

α =

1.4

RC =

the replacement cost calculated in accordance with Rule A4.8.3

PFE =

the amount for potential future exposure calculated in accordance with Rule A4.8.6

(2) The maximum Exposure value for a Margined Netting Set is the Exposure value of

the same Netting Set as if it were an Unmargined Netting Set.

(3)

If multiple Margin Agreements apply to a single Netting Set, an Authorised Firm must divide each Margin Agreement into sub-Netting Sets, each aligning with its respective Margin Agreement and calculate the Exposure value of the original Netting Set by taking the sum of the Exposure value of each sub-Netting set.

(4) An Authorised Firm may set to zero the Exposure value for sold options that are:

(a) not included in any netting or Margin Agreement; or

(b)

the only types of Exposures in a Netting Set,

provided all premia have been paid upfront.

(5) An Authorised Firm may cap the Exposure value of a credit derivative at the

amount of unpaid premia if all the following conditions are met:

(a)

the Authorised Firm is the protection seller;

(b)

the credit derivative is not included in any netting or Margin Agreement.

(6) Where eligible Collateral is taken outside a Netting Set but is available to an Authorised Firm to offset default losses from transactions subject to this section, an Authorised Firm must calculate the Exposure
