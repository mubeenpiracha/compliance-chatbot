maturity factor, MFi, as follows:

(a)

for transactions included in an Unmargined Netting Set, the maturity factor must be calculated as follows:

MFi = √min (max(Mi;

10 OneBusinessYear

);1)

where:

Mi =

the period between the calculation day (today) and the latest date when the transaction ‘i’ may still be active, measured in years; if a transaction ’i’ has another derivative contract as its underlying and may be physically exercised into the underlying contract, then Mi the contract is the time period between the calculation date and the final settlement date of the underlying transaction. For a transaction that is structured such that on specified dates any outstanding exposure is settled and the terms are reset so that the fair value of the contract is zero, the remaining maturity, Mi , equals the time until the next reset date
