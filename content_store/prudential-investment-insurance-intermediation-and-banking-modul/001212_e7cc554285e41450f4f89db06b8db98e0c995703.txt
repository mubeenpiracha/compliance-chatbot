Guidance

The DFSA may use its discretion under Rule A9.2.9 to approve other types of assets as HQLA including, but not limited to, Sharâ€™iah compliant financial products. When the DFSA approves assets it may define the conditions that the assets must satisfy to be treated as HQLA. It must specify whether the assets are to be treated as Level 1 HQLA or Level 2A or 2B HQLA.

Other provisions relating to LCR calculation

A9.2.10 For the purpose of calculating the LCR, if an eligible asset within HQLA becomes ineligible (e.g. due to a rating downgrade), an Authorised Firm is allowed to keep the asset in its stock of HQLA for an additional 30 calendar days to allow time to adjust its stock as needed or replace the asset.
