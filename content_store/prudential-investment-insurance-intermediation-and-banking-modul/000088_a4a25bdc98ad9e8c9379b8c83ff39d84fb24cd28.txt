Guidance

A Category 3A Authorised Firm may be authorised to conduct other Financial Services, but it is the authorisation for Dealing in Investments as Agent and the absence of authorisation for the activities specified in Rules 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 that are determinative of its belonging to Category 3A.
