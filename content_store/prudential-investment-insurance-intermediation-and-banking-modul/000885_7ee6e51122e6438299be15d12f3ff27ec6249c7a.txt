the volatility of a risk factor (‘Volatility Transactions’).

(3) For the purpose of (2)(a), an Authorised Firm must form a separate hedging set for

each specific pair of risk factors.

Guidance

1.

Examples of specific bases of Basis Transactions include three-month SOFR versus six-month SOFR, three-month SOFR versus three-month T-Bill, one-month SOFR versus overnight indexed swap rate, Brent Crude oil versus Henry Hub gas.

2.

Transactions with two floating legs that are denominated in different currencies (such as cross- currency swaps) are not subject to the treatment in Rule A4.8.5(2)(a) and should be treated as non- basis foreign exchange transactions.

3.

For hedging sets consisting of Basis Transactions, long and short positions should be determined with respect to the basis.

4.

Examples of Volatility Transactions include variance and volatility swaps, options and realised or implied volatility. Volatility hedging sets follow the hedging set construction under Rule A4.8.5(1). For example, all equity volatility transactions form a single hedging set.
