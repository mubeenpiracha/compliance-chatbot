 not move the market or represent a price reflecting a market discount (in the case of Collateral) or premium (in the case of an OTC derivative). Examples of situations where transactions are deemed illiquid for this purpose include, transactions that are not marked daily and transactions that are subject to specific accounting treatment for valuation purposes (for example OTC derivatives referencing securities whose fair value is determined by models with inputs that are not observed in the market).

Effective notional for options

(1) An Authorised Firm must calculate the effective notional amount under Rule

A4.8.12 for single-payment options as follows:

(a)

for Asian options, the underlying price, Pùëñ, must be set equal to the current value of the average used in the payoff;

(b)

for American and Bermudan options, the latest allowed exercise date must be set as the exercise date, Tùëñ;

(c)

for Bermudan swaptions, the Start Date must be equal to the earliest allowed exercise date, while the End Date must be equal to the End Date of the underlying swap;

(d)

for digital options, the payoff of each digital option (bought or sold) with strike, Kùëñ, must be approximated via a collar combination of bought and sold European options of the same type (call or put) with strikes set equal to 0.95 ‚àô Kùëñ and 1.05 ‚àô Kùëñ; the size of the position in the collar components must be such that the digital payoff is reproduced exactly outside the region between the two strikes; the effective notional amount for each component European option must be calculated separately using the formulae in Rule A4.8.12 with Tùëñ set equal to the exercise date of the digital option and Pùëñ set equal to the current value of the underlying for the digital option; the absolute value of the digital option effective notional amount must be capped by the ratio of the digital payoff to the relevant supervisory factor; and

(e)

if an option can be represented as a combination of European option payoffs, each European option component must be calculated separately.

(2) For the purpose of (1) an Authorised Firm may represent multiple payment options

as a combination of single payment options as follows:

(a)

interest rate caps or floors may be represented as the portfolio of individual caplets or floorlets, where each caplet or floorlet is treated as a European option on the floating interest rate over a specific coupon period; and

(b)

for each caplet or floorlet, the Start Date and exercise date, Tùëñ, must be set equal to the start of the coupon period and the End Date must be set equal to the end of the coupon period.

Supervisory parameters

(1) When calculating the PFE add-on for each asset class, an Authorised Firm must, subject to (2), determine, the supervisory factor, the supervisory correlation parameter and the supervisory volatility in accordance with the table below:
