Commitment to underwrite Securities

A5.8.3 (1)

For the purpose of Rule A5.8.1, an Authorised Firm underwrites or sub- underwrites an issue of Securities where:

(a)

it gives a commitment to an Issuer of Securities to underwrite an issue of Securities;

(b)

in the case of new Securities (as defined in Rule A5.8.4) it gives a commitment to a seller of Securities to underwrite a sale of those Securities;

(c)

it gives a commitment to a person, other than the Issuer of Securities or, if (b) applies, the seller of the Securities, to sub-underwrite an issue of Securities; or

(d)

it is a member of a syndicate or Group that gives a commitment of the type described in (a) to (c).

(2)

Unless a Rule deals with an issue of Securities separately or the context otherwise requires, a provision of section A5.8 that deals with Underwriting also applies to sub-underwriting.
