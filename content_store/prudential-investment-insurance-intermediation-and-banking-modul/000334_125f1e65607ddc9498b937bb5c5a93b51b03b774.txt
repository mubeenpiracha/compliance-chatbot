4.11.4 An Authorised Firm must use its chosen recognised external credit rating agencies and their external credit assessments consistently for each type of Exposure, for both risk weighting and risk management purposes. Where an Authorised Firm has two external credit assessments which map into different Credit Quality Grades, it must assign the CR Exposure to the Credit Quality Grade associated with the higher risk weight. Where an Authorised Firm has three or more external credit assessments which map into two or more different Credit Quality Grades, it must assign the CR Exposure to the Credit Quality Grade associated with the higher of the two lowest risk weights.
