Parameters of the internal IRC model

4.

Authorised Firms should use the internal model to calculate a number which measures losses due to default and internal or external ratings migration at the 99.9 % confidence interval over a time horizon of one year. Authorised Firms should calculate this number at least weekly.

5.

Correlation assumptions should be supported by analysis of objective data in a conceptually sound framework. The internal model should appropriately reflect issuer concentrations. Concentrations that can arise within and across product classes under stressed conditions should also be reflected.

6.

The internal IRC model should reflect the impact of correlations between default and migration events. The impact of diversification between, on the one hand, default and migration events and, on the other hand, other risk factors should not be reflected.
