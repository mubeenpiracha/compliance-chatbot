Guidance

The calculation of the add-on for the credit asset class only gives full recognition of the offsetting of long and short positions for derivatives that reference the same entity (e.g. the same corporate issuer of bonds). Partial offsetting is recognised between derivatives that reference different entities.

Add-on for transactions in the equity asset class

A4.8.10 (1) An Authorised Firm must divide the transactions of each hedging set of the equity asset class into different categories with each category containing all the transactions referencing the same entity or index.

(2) An Authorised Firm must calculate the add-on for hedging set ‘j’ of the equity asset

class, AddOnj

EQ, using the following formula:
