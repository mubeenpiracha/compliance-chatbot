where:

ρ =

50%, the supervisory correlation parameter

C =

the index that denotes all counterparties for which the firm uses BA-CVA to calculate its Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Capital Requirement

SCVAC =

the Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Capital Requirement for Counterparty ‘C’ on a standalone basis, calculated in accordance with Rule A5.10.5

SNHC =

the quantity that gives recognition to the reduction in CVA Risk of Counterparty ‘C’ arising from the Authorised Firm’s use of single-name hedges of credit spread risk, calculated in accordance with Rule A5.10.9

IH =

the quantity that gives recognition to the reduction in CVA Risk across all Counterparties arising from the Authorised Firm’s use of index hedges, calculated in accordance with Rule A5.10.10

HMHC =

the quantity accordance with Rule A5.10.11

representing hedging misalignment, calculated

in

A5.10.9 For the purposes of Rule A5.10.8, an Authorised Firm must calculate SNHC, using the

where:

rhc =

the supervisory correlation between the credit spread risk of Counterparty ‘C’ and the credit spread of a single-name hedge ‘h’ of Counterparty ‘C’ determined in accordance with the table Rule A5.10.12

SN =

Mh

the remaining maturity of a single-name hedge ‘h’ recognised as an Eligible CVA Hedge

SN =

Bh

the notional of a single-name hedge ‘h’ recognised as an Eligible CVA Hedge (for single-name contingent credit default swaps, the notional must be determined by the current market value of the reference portfolio or instrument)
