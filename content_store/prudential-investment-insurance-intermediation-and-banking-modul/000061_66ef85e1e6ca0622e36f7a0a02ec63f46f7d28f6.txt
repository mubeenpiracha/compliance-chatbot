Credit procedures manual

An Authorised Firm must implement and maintain a documented credit procedures manual, which sets out the criteria and procedures for granting new credits, for approving extensions of existing credits and exceptions, for conducting periodic and independent reviews of credits granted and for maintaining the records for credits granted.

The credit procedures manual must establish:

(a)

sound, well-defined criteria for granting credit, including a thorough understanding of the borrower or Counterparty, the purpose and structure of the credit and its source of repayment;

(b)

well defined processes for approving new Exposures as well as renewing and refinancing existing Exposures;

(c)

effective credit administration processes, including continued analysis of a borrower’s ability and willingness to repay under the terms of the debt, monitoring of documentation, legal covenants, contractual requirements and Collateral;

(d)

effective processes for classification and grading of credit assets consistent with the nature, size and complexity of the Authorised Firm’s activities;

(e)

comprehensive processes for reporting Exposures on an ongoing basis; and

(f)

comprehensive processes for identifying problem assets, managing problem assets, monitoring their collections and for estimating required level of provisions.

Guidance

The same criteria should be applied to both advised and unadvised facilities and should deal with all Credit Risks associated with the Authorised Firm’s business whether in the Non-Trading or Trading Book or on or off balance sheet.

Processes for credit assessment

(1)

When utilising external credit rating agencies as part of its credit assessment processes, an Authorised Firm must:

(a)

maintain an internal credit grading system; and

(b)

stress test its capital position on at least an annual basis to consider the capital implications to the Authorised Firm of a significant reduction in the credit quality and associated reduction on credit ratings from credit rating agencies for its credit portfolio.

(2)

An Authorised Firm must not solely use external credit rating agency credit ratings as a basis for its assessment of the risks associated with an Exposure, in particular in respect of a Large Exposure, and must at all times conduct its own credit assessment of such an Exposure.
