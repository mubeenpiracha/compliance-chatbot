Guidance

1.

For the purposes of Rule 3.2.2, an Authorised Firm’s Governing Body should assess whether the Capital Resources which are required by the DFSA as set out in PIB are adequate in relation to the Authorised Firm’s specific business. Additional resources should be maintained by the Authorised Firm where its Governing Body has considered that the required Capital Resources do not adequately reflect the nature and risks of the Authorised Firm’s business.

2.

The liabilities referred to in Rule 3.2.2(b) include an Authorised Firm’s contingent and prospective liabilities, such as liabilities arising from a change in business strategy or claims made against the Authorised Firm, but not liabilities that might arise from prospective transactions which the Authorised Firm could avoid, for example by ceasing its operations. Liabilities from prospective transactions refers to the potential liabilities which can be avoided by either adequate risk management, risk transfer or avoiding the transaction completely. This refers to any prospective transaction, for example, lending money to a borrower or entering into a contract for the provision of services by a service provider.
