 the FCSA approach, the use or potential use by that Fund of Derivative instruments solely to hedge investments listed in Rule 4.13.5 should not preclude the Units in that Fund from being recognised as eligible financial Collateral.

Requirements for Recognition of Collateral

4.13.8 An Authorised Firm must ensure that the following requirements are complied with

before it recognises the effects of Credit Risk mitigation of any Collateral:

(a)

the legal mechanism by which Collateral is pledged, assigned or transferred must confer on the Authorised Firm the right to liquidate or take legal possession of the Collateral, in a timely manner, in the event of the default, insolvency or bankruptcy (or one or more otherwise-defined credit events set out in the transaction documentation) of the Counterparty (and, where applicable, of the custodian holding the Collateral);

(b)

the Authorised Firm has taken all steps necessary to fulfil those requirements under the law applicable to the Authorised Firm’s interest in the Collateral for obtaining and maintaining an enforceable security interest by registering it with a registrar or for exercising a right to net or set off in relation to title transfer Collateral;

(c)

the credit quality of the Counterparty and the value of the Collateral do not have a material positive correlation;

(d)

securities issued by the Counterparty or any Closely Related Counterparty are not eligible;

(e)

the Authorised Firm has implemented procedures for the timely liquidation of Collateral to ensure that any legal conditions required for declaring default of Counterparty and liquidating the Collateral are observed, and that the Collateral can be liquidated promptly;

(f)

for an Authorised Firm using the FCSA, the Collateral has been marked to market and revalued at least every six months or more frequently if required by business or market circumstances;

(g)

the Authorised Firm has dedicated sufficient resource to the orderly operation of margin agreements with OTC derivatives and securities- financing Counterparties, as measured by the timeliness and accuracy of their outgoing margin calls and response time to incoming margin calls;

(h)

the Authorised Firm has implemented Collateral risk management policies to control, monitor and report:

4.13.9

PRUDENTIAL – INVESTMENT, INSURANCE INTERMEDIATION AND BANKING (PIB)

(i)

the risk to which margin agreements expose them (such as the volatility and liquidity of the securities exchanged as Collateral);

(ii) the concentration risk to particular types of Collateral;

(iii) the reuse of Collateral (both cash and non-cash) including the potential liquidity shortfalls resulting from the reuse of Collateral received from Counterparties; and

(iv) the surrender of rights on Collateral posed to Counterparties; and

(i)

where the Collateral is held by a custodian, the Authorised Firm has taken reasonable steps to ensure that the custodian segregates the Collateral from its own assets.

Guidance

In determining if there is a material positive correlation as referred to in Rule 4.13.8(c), an Authorised Firm should take into account several factors, including the consistency of any correlation over time, the incidental nature of any correlation (whether it will hold for over a one-year horizon) or whether any correlation may lead to larger or smaller swings in potential credit losses.
