 to a risk of loss on the full amount of cash paid or deliverables delivered. PIB Rule A4.6.3 requires an Authorised Firm that has made the first contractual payment/delivery leg to calculate RWAs for the Exposure if the second leg has not been received by the end of the business day. The RWAs increase if the second leg has not been received within five business days.

4.

This section applies to transactions whether on balance sheet or off balance sheet. Where a transaction does not appear on balance sheet (i.e. settlement date accounting), the Authorised Firm should apply a 100% conversion factor to determine the credit equivalent amount of the unsettled exposure amount.

5.

An Authorised Firm should develop, implement and improve systems for tracking and monitoring the credit risk exposure arising from unsettled transactions and failed trades as appropriate so that they can produce management information that facilitates timely action. An Authorised Firm should closely monitor securities, commodities, and foreign exchange transactions that have failed, starting the first day they fail.

Unsettled Transactions

A4.6.2 An Authorised Firm must calculate the RWA for a transaction that remains unsettled after

its due delivery date, using the following formula:

CRW = PCEA ∙ RM ∙ 12.5

where:

PCEA =

the positive current exposure amount of the transaction representing the difference between the agreed settlement price for the instrument in question and its current market value, where the difference could involve a loss for the Authorised Firm

RM =

the risk multiplier, determined in accordance with the table below
