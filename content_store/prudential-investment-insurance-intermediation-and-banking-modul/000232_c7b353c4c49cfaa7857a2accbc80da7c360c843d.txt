Working day 0

A5.8.9 For the purposes of section A5.8, working day 0 is the business day on which a firm that is Underwriting or sub-underwriting becomes unconditionally committed to accepting a known quantity of Securities at a specified price.

Guidance

For debt issues and securities which are issued in a similar manner, working day 0 is the later of the date on which the securities are allotted and the date on which payment for them is due. For equity issues and securities which are issued in a similar manner, working day 0 is the later of the date on which the offer becomes closed for subscriptions and the date on which the allocations are made public. For rights issues, working day 0 is the first day after the date on which the offer becomes closed to acceptances for subscription.
