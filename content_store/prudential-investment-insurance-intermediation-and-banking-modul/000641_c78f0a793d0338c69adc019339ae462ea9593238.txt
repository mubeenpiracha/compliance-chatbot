In accordance with Rules 3.2.2 or 3.2.4, an Authorised Firm is required to ensure that there is no significant risk that liabilities cannot be met as they fall due. With specific reference to liquidity, an Authorised Firm may meet its obligations in a number of ways, including:

a.

by holding sufficient immediately available cash or unencumbered readily marketable assets; and

b.

by securing an appropriate matching future profile of cashflows.
