(2) An Authorised Firm must calculate the PFE of multiple Netting Sets that are subject to a single Margin Agreement, as referred to in Rule A4.8.3(4), as the sum of the PFE of all the individual Netting Sets as if they were not subject to any form of Margin Agreement.

(3) For the purpose of (1) an Authorised Firm must calculate the multiplier as follows:

multiplier = min{1;Floor + (1 − Floor) ∙ exp(

V − CH 2 ∙ (1 − Floor) ∙ AddOnagg)}

where:

Floor =

5%

V =

the total current market value of all the transactions in the Netting Set

CH =

CH(one year) for Unmargined Netting Sets and CH(MPoR) for Margined Netting Sets (refer to Rule A4.8.3(1) and (2), respectively)

AddOnagg = the aggregated add-on factors for each asset class, calculated in

accordance with (4)

(4) For the purpose of (1) an Authorised Firm must calculate the AddOnagg, as follows:

AddOnagg = ∑AddOna

a

where:

a =

the index that denotes the asset class (interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity and commodity) included in the calculation of the potential future exposure of the Netting Set

AddOna =

the add-on for asset class ‘a’

(5) For each asset class ‘a’, an Authorised Firm must calculate the add-on factor, AddOna, as the sum of all hedging set level add-ons within asset class ‘a’ as follows:

a AddOn𝑎 = ∑AddOnj

j

where:

j =

the index that denotes all hedging sets of an asset class ‘a’, formed in accordance with Rule A4.8.5

AddOnj

a = add-on for hedging set ‘j’ within asset class ‘a’

Guidance

Diversification benefits across asset classes are not recognised. Instead, the respective add-ons for each asset class are aggregated using the formula in A4.8.6(5) (where the sum is across the asset classes).

Add-on for transactions in the interest rate asset class

A4.8.7 (1) An Authorised Firm must map transactions within each hedging set of the interest rate asset class to the appropriate maturity bucket in the table below on the basis of the End Date of each transaction.

(2) An Authorised Firm must calculate the add-on for each hedging set ‘j’ of the interest IR, using the following formula:

rate asset class, AddOnj

AddOnj

IR = SFIR ∙ EffNotj

IR

where:

SFIR =

the supervisory factor for the interest rate asset class, determined in accordance with Rule A4.8.18

EffNotj

IR = the effective notional amount of hedging set ‘j’, calculated in

accordance with (3)

j =

the index that denotes all hedging sets of the interest rate asset class, formed in accordance with Rule A4.8.5

(3) For the purpose of (2), an Authorised Firm must calculate the effective notional IR, by aggregating the effective notional amounts
