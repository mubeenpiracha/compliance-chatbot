(b)

the Authorised Firm has taken all steps necessary to fulfil those requirements under the law applicable to the Authorised Firmâ€™s interest in the Collateral for obtaining and maintaining an enforceable security interest by registering it with a registrar or for exercising a right to net or set off in relation to title transfer Collateral;
