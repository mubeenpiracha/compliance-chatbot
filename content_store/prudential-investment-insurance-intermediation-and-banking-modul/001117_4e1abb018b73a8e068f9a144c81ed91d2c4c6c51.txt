15. An Authorised Firm should count daily violations on the basis of back-testing on hypothetical and actual changes in the portfolio's value. A violation for this purpose is defined as a one-day change in the portfolio's value that exceeds the related one-day VaR number generated by the Authorised Firm's model. For the purpose of determining the addend the number of violations should be assessed at least on a quarterly basis and should be equal to the higher of the number of violations under hypothetical and actual changes in the value of the portfolio. Back-testing on hypothetical changes in the portfolio's value should be based on a comparison between the portfolio's end-of-day value and, assuming unchanged positions, its value at the end of the subsequent day. Back-testing on actual changes in the portfolio's value should be based on a comparison between the portfolio's end-of-day value and its actual value at the end of the subsequent day excluding fees, commissions, and net interest income.
