Large Exposure risk from underwriting securities: Calculating the net underwriting Exposure

A5.8.11 For Concentration Risk purposes, the total amount of an Authorised Firmâ€™s Trading Book Exposures to any Person must include net Underwriting Exposure to that Person.

A5.8.12 An Authorised Firm must include any other Exposures arising out of underwriting (including any Counterparty Exposures to any sub-underwriters) for the purposes of calculating the total amount of its Trading Book Exposures to a Person for Concentration Risk purposes.

A5.8.13 An Authorised Firm, before entering into a new Underwriting commitment, must be able to recalculate the Concentration Risk capital component to the level of detail necessary to ensure that the firm's Capital Resources Requirement does not exceed the firm's Capital Resources.
