Guidance

1.

Group membership may be a source of both strength and weakness to an Authorised Firm. The purpose of Group Risk requirements is to ensure that an Authorised Firm takes proper account of the risks related to the Authorised Firm’s membership of a Group. The Group Risk requirements form a key part of the DFSA’s overall approach to prudential supervision.

2.

Section 8.5 imposes important restrictions on the ability of Authorised Firms in Category 3A, 3B, 3C, 3D or 4, and non-regulated Financial Institutions, to be a Parent of an Authorised Firm in Category 1 or 5, or of a firm carrying on similar activities outside of the DIFC.
