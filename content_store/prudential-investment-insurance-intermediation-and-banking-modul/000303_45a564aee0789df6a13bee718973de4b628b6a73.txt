monitoring of credits and early identification of credit quality deterioration;

(c)

An Authorised Firm must ensure that each and every credit which qualifies as a Large Exposure and is classified as an impaired credit is managed individually. This includes valuation, classification and provisioning for such credits on an individual item basis.

Any evergreening exercise involving refinancing of past due credits must not result in their being classified as a higher category. In particular, impaired credits cannot be refinanced with the aim of classifying them as standard or special mention credits.

An Authorised Firm’s provisioning policy must specify the following minimum provisioning requirements:

(a)

for substandard assets – 20% of the unsecured portion of the credit;

(b)

for doubtful assets – 50% of the unsecured portion of the credit; and

(c)

for loss assets – 100% of the unsecured portion of the credit.
