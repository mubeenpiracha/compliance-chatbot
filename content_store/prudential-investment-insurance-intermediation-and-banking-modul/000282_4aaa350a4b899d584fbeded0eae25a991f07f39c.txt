Both unweighted and weighted values of the NSFR components must be disclosed unless otherwise indicated. Weighted values are calculated as the values after ASF or RSF Factors are applied.

In completing the NSFR disclosure table, Authorised Firms should follow the instructions below. The numbers in the instructions correspond to the relevant row numbers in the quantitative disclosures section of the table.

1.

Capital is the sum of rows 2 and 3.
