An Authorised Firm must risk-weight any specialised lending Exposure for which a directly applicable external credit assessment by a recognised external credit rating agency is not available as follows:

(a) where the purpose is to finance the acquisition of physical assets (such as ships, aircraft, satellites, railcars or fleets) and where the repayment of the Exposure is dependent on the cash flows generated by the specific assets that have been financed and pledged or assigned to the lender (“Object Finance”), by assigning a risk weight of 100%;

(b) where the purpose is to provide short-term financing of reserves, inventories or receivables of exchange-traded commodities (such as crude oil, metals or crops) and where the Exposure will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the commodity and the obligor has no independent capacity to repay the Exposure (“Commodities Finance”), by assigning a risk weight of 100%;

(c) where the purpose is to finance a project for the development of large, complex and expensive installations such as power plants, chemical processing plants, mines, transportation infrastructure, environment, media or telecoms and where the revenues generated by a single project are primarily the source of repayment and security for the Exposure (referred to as “Project Finance”), by assigning a risk weight of 130% during the pre-operational phase and, subject to (5), 100% during the operational phase.

(4)

For the purpose of (3)(c) operational phase means the phase in which the entity that was created to finance the project has:

(a) a positive cash flow that is sufficient to cover any remaining contractual

obligation; and

(b) declining long-term debt.

(5) Where a Project Finance Exposure is in the operational phase and is considered high quality in accordance with the criteria in (6), an Authorised Firm may assign a risk weight of 80%.

(6)

A Project Finance Exposure is considered high quality if:

(a)

it is an Exposure to an entity that is able to meet its financial commitments in a timely manner and its ability to do so is assessed to be robust against adverse changes in the economic cycle and business conditions; and

(b)

the following conditions are met:

(i)

the entity is restricted from acting to the detriment of the creditors (including by not being able to issue additional debt without the consent of existing creditors);

(ii)

the entity has sufficient reserve financial arrangements to cover the contingency funding and working capital requirements of the project;

funds or other

(iii)

the revenues are availability-based or subject to a rate-of-return regulation or take-or-pay contract;

(iv)

the entity’s revenue depends on one main counterparty and this main counterparty is a central government, PSE or a corporate entity with a risk weight of 80% or lower;

(v)

the contractual provisions governing the Exposure to the entity provide for a high degree of protection for creditors in case of default of the entity;

(vi)

the main counterparty or other counterparties which similarly comply with the eligibility criteria for the main counterparty will protect the creditors from the losses resulting from a termination of the project;

(vii) all assets and contracts necessary to operate the project have been pledged to the creditors to the extent permitted by applicable law; and

(viii) creditors may assume control of the entity in case of its default.

(7)

For the purpose of (6)(b)(iii), revenues are availability-based if:

(a)

the entity is entitled to payments from its contractual counterparties once construction is completed, as long as contractual conditions are fulfilled;

(b)

the payments are sized to cover operating and maintaining costs, debt service costs and equity returns as the entity operates the project; and

(c)

the revenues are not subject to swings in demand, such as traffic levels, and are adjusted typically only for lack of performance or lack of availability of the assets to the public.
