Clear policies and procedures should be established in respect of Collateral management, including:

a.

the terms of Collateral agreements;

b.

the types of Collateral and enforcement of Collateral terms (e.g. waivers of posting deadlines);

c.

the management of legal risks;

d.

the administration of agreement (e.g. detailed plans for determining default and liquidating Collateral); and

e.

the prompt resolution of disputes, such as valuation of Collateral or positions, acceptability of Collateral, fulfilment of legal obligations and the interpretation of contract terms.

The policies and procedures referred to under Guidance note 1(d) should be supported by Collateral management systems capable of tracking the location and status of posted Collateral (including re-hypothecated Collateral), outstanding Collateral calls and settlement problems.
