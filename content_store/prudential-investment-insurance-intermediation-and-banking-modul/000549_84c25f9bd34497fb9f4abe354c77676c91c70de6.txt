Guidance

Section 5.3 of the GEN module contains Rules and Guidance in relation to Systems and Controls, some of which may relate to the management of Operational Risk. The Corporate Governance rules in the GEN module set out overarching requirements in relation to Board responsibilities, including risk management. The Rules and Guidance in this section seek to complement the aforementioned requirements, while providing for a framework to address matters which directly relate to Operational Risk management.
