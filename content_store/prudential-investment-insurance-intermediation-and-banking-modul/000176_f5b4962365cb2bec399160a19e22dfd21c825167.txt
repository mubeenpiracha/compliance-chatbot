 cases where there is an undertaking to provide a commitment on another off-balance sheet Exposure, an Authorised Firm should apply the lower of the applicable CCFs. For example, if an Authorised Firm has a commitment to open self-liquidating trade letters of credit arising from the movement of goods, in particular documentary credits collateralised by the underlying shipment with an Original Maturity of less than one year, a 20% CCF should be applied instead of a 40% CCF.

Calculation of E* for collateralised transactions under FCCA

A4.3.2 An Authorised Firm using the FCCA must, subject to A4.3.3, calculate the Exposure amount after risk mitigation, E*, of a collateralised transaction other than transactions referred to in Rule 4.14A1(a) to (c), using the following formula:
