RC = max {V − C𝐻(MPoR);TH + MTA − NICA;O}

where:

V =

the total current market value of all the transactions in the Netting Set

CH(MPoR) =

the haircut value of net Collateral held, calculated in accordance with (3), with a holding period of MPoR

TH =

the positive threshold before the Counterparty must send the Authorised Firm collateral

MTA =

the minimum transfer amount applicable to the Counterparty

NICA =

the net independent Collateral amount

(3) For the purpose of (1) and (2), an Authorised Firm must calculate the haircut value

of net Collateral, CH, using the following formula:

CH(t) = {

C ∙ (1 − H(t)),if C ≥ 0 C ∙ (1 + H(t)),if C < 0
