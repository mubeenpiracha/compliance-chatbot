For commodity Murabaha transactions, a run-off factor of 100% should be applied to the balance of the Murabaha payable, if the remaining term of the contract does not exceed 30 days. If early withdrawal of the original amount is allowed at the discretion of the Authorised Firm with no mark-up, then the applicable run-off factor will be the same as that for the relevant category of deposit or Unrestricted PSIA under the Table.
