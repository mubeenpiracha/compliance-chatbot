The concentration test

A5.3.22 An Authorised Firm must apply either the standard method or simplified method to an equity position, except that where an individual net position exceeds 20% of the sum of the long and short positions (ignoring the sign) of its country portfolio, the simplified method must be applied to the excess.

Guidance

The part of the individual net position that does not exceed 20% may be treated under the simplified or standard method.

Standard method

A5.3.23 Under the standard method, the total Equity Risk Capital Requirement is the sum of the Specific Risk requirements for all individual net equity positions and the General Market Risk requirements calculated separately for each country.
