10. Authorised Firms should establish and maintain procedures for judging the necessity of and calculating an adjustment to the current valuation of less liquid positions for regulatory capital purposes. This adjustment may be in addition to any changes to the value of the position required for financial reporting purposes and should be designed to reflect the illiquidity of the position. The DFSA expects Authorised Firms to consider the need for an adjustment to a position’s valuation to reflect current illiquidity whether the position is marked-to-market using market prices or observable inputs, third-party valuations or marked-to-model. Bearing in mind that the assumptions made in relation to calculating VaR may not be consistent with the Authorised Firm’s ability to sell or hedge out less liquid positions, where appropriate, Authorised Firms should take an adjustment to the current valuation of these positions, and review their continued appropriateness on an on-going basis. Reduced liquidity may have arisen from market events. Additionally, close-out prices for concentrated positions and/or stale positions should be considered in establishing the adjustment.
