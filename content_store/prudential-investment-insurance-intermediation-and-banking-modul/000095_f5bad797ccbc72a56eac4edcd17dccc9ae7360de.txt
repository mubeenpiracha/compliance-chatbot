Systemically Important Banks (SIBs)

Guidance

1. This section provides for the DFSA to be able to designate an Authorised Firm as a Systemically Important Bank (SIB). A SIB is a bank whose impact, if it were to fail, could cause significant disruption to the financial system and the broader economy. To address the additional risks that SIBs pose, SIBs are subject to specific regulatory and supervisory measures, including higher capital charges in the form of an additional buffer (an HLA Capital Buffer) and more intensive supervision.
