Interpretation

4.14.2 For the purposes of this chapter and App4, “securitisation” includes Traditional

Securitisation, Synthetic Securitisation and Re-securitisation, as defined below:

(a)

A Traditional Securitisation is a structure where the cash flow from an underlying pool of Exposures is used to service at least two different stratified risk positions or tranches reflecting different degrees of Credit Risk. Payments to the investors depend upon the performance of the specified underlying Exposures, as opposed to being derived from an obligation of the entity originating those Exposures. A Traditional Securitisation will generally assume the movement of assets off balance sheet.
