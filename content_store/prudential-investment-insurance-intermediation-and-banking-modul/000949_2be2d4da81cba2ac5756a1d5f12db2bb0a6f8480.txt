Guidance:

1.

In order to be applicable under (c) the guarantees must meet the requirements of section 4.13.9 in relation to Credit Risk mitigation.

2.

An Authorised Firm can only treat Exposures as Collateralised provided the conditions of Rules 4.13.5 to 4.13.8 (relating to Credit Risk mitigation) are met. Item (d) also includes cash received under a credit linked note issued by the Authorised Firm and loans and deposits of a Counterparty to or with the Authorised Firm which are subject to an on balance sheet Netting agreement recognised under section 4.13 (Credit Risk mitigation).

3.

The DFSA may consider a waiver for other sovereign Exposures where there is a local regulatory requirement to hold assets with a national regulatory authority. Authorised Firms will be required to apply for a waiver of the Large Exposure requirements in this regard and will be considered by the DFSA on a case by case basis.
