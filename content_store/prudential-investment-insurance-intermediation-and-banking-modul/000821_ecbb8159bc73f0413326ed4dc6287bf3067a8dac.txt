51. Depending on the size and nature of the Authorised Firm, it may be appropriate for problem Exposures to be managed by a specialised function, independent of the functions that originate the business or maintain the on-going business relationship with the Counterparty.

52.

Exposures identified as problems or potential problems should be closely monitored by management, and an Authorised Firm should set out, for example, whether a loan grading system or a watch or problem list is used and, in the latter case, the criteria for adding an asset to or taking an asset off that list.

53.

It is recommended that Authorised Firms establish a dedicated unit to handle the recovery and work- out of problem loans and put in place policies for the referral of loans to this unit.

54. An Authorised Firm should have adequate procedures for recovering Exposures in arrears or those which had provisions made against them. These should allocate responsibility both internally and externally for its arrears management and recovery and define the involvement of the Authorised Firm's solicitors. Requirements relating to provisioning against loss on problem Exposures are covered in chapter 4.
