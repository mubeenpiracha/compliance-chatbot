Shari’a compliant hedging liabilities (e.g. Islamic swaps) are calculated first based on the replacement cost for the Shari’a compliant hedging contracts (obtained by marking to market), such as ISDA/IIFM Tahawwut Master Agreement (TMA), where the contract has a negative value. When an eligible bilateral netting contract is in place, the replacement cost for the set of Shari’a compliant hedging exposures covered by the contract will be the net replacement cost.
