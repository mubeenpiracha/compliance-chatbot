Under Rule A9.2.3(a), the control of the HQLA may be evidenced either by:

(b)

demonstrating that the relevant function can monetise the asset at any point in the 30- day stress period and that the proceeds are available to the function throughout the 30- day stress period without directly conflicting with a stated business or risk management strategy.
