The minimum frequency of an evaluation of the effect of a sudden and unexpected parallel change in interest rates as referred to in Rule 7.2.2 is once each quarter.

Guidance

For the purposes of Rule 7.2.6, an Authorised Firm should consider the standards for stress testing recommended in the paper published by the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision – Principles for management and supervision of interest rate risk – in July 2004. In particular, an Authorised Firm should include the technical specifications of a standardised interest rate shock detailed in Annex 3 of that paper as part of its systems for measurement of interest rate risk in the Non-Trading Book.
