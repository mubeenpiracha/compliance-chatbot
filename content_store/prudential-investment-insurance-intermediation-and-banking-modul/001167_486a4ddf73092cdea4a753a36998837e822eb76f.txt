(b)

subject to (c), may in any given year offset negative a Capital Requirement (resulting from negative gross income) in any business line against positive capital charges in other business lines without limit; and

(c)

must input to the numerator a value of zero if the aggregate Operational Risk Capital Requirement across all business lines within a given year is negative.

Operational Risk Capital Requirement according to the following formula:

KSA =  years 1-3 max[(GI 1-8 X B1-8) , 0]}/ 3
