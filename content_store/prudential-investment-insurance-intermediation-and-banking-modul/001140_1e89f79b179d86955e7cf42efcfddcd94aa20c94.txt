(ii)

supervisory scenarios requiring a simulation by the Authorised Firm – the Authorised Firm must subject its portfolio to a series of simulated stress scenarios and provide the DFSA with the results (e.g., the sensitivity of the Authorised Firm’s Market Risk Exposure to changes in the assumptions about volatilities and correlations); and

(iii) scenarios developed by the Authorised Firm itself to capture the

specific characteristics of its portfolio.

(2)

In addition to the scenarios prescribed under (1)(c), an Authorised Firm must also develop its own stress tests which it identifies as most adverse, based on the characteristics of its portfolio, for example, problems arising in a key region of the world combined with a sharp move in oil prices. The Authorised Firm must also provide the DFSA with a description of the methodology used to identify and carry out the scenarios as well as with a description of the results derived from these scenarios.
