PART 5 – Calculating the Leverage Ratio

3.18 Leverage Ratios

3.18.1 This section applies to an Authorised Firm in Category 1, 2 (other than a Matched

Principal) or 5.

Guidance

This section is relevant to an Authorised Firm that is required to report its Leverage Ratio to the DFSA under chapter 2, or to disclose its Leverage Ratio under chapter 11, of these Rules.

3.18.2 An Authorised Firm must calculate its Leverage Ratio in accordance with the following

formula:

Leverage Ratio = Capital Measure ÷ Exposure Measure

where:

(a)

“Capital Measure” represents Tier 1 Capital of the Authorised Firm calculated in accordance with Rule 3.12.1; and

(b)

“Exposure Measure” represents the value of exposures of the Authorised Firm calculated in accordance with Rule 3.18.3.

3.18.3 For the purpose of determining the Exposure Measure, the value of exposures of an Authorised Firm must be calculated in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) subject to the following adjustments:

(a)

on-balance sheet, non-derivative exposures must be net of specific allowances and valuation adjustments (e.g. credit valuation adjustments);

(b)

physical or financial collateral, guarantees or credit risk mitigation purchased must not be used to reduce on-balance sheet exposures; and

(c)

loans must not be netted with deposits;

(d)

collateral must not be netted against a derivative position, whether or not netting is allowed;

(e)

collateral posted against a derivative position must be added to the Exposure Measure if posting the collateral has resulted in a reduction in the Firm’s balance sheet;
