The supervisory delta is used to ensure that the effective notional amounts take into account the direction of the trade, i.e. whether the trade is long or short, by having a positive or negative sign. It also takes into account whether the trade has a non-linear relationship with the underlying risk factor (which is the case for options and collateralised debt obligation tranches).

To calculate the supervisory delta for options an Authorised Firm should use, whenever appropriate, the forward (rather than the spot) value of the underlying in order to account for the risk-free rate as well as for possible cash flows prior to the option expiry (such as dividends).
