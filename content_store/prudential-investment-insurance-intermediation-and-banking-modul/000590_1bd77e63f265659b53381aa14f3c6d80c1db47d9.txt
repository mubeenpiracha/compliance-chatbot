confidentiality and integrity of Users’ personal security credentials.

Guidance

1. An Authorised Firm should, as best practice in maintaining the integrity of strong customer authentication, try to ensure that:

(a) no element of ‘knowledge’, ‘possession’ or ‘inherence’ (as defined in Rule 6.13.2) can be

derived from the disclosure of the authentication code cover;

(b)

it is not possible to generate a new authentication code based on an old one;

(c)

the authentication code cannot be forged;

(d) where the authentication through a remote channel has failed to generate an authentication

code, it is not possible to identify which of the SCA elements was incorrect;

(e) a maximum of 5 failed consecutive authentication attempts within a given period result in

the account being temporarily or permanently blocked;

(f)

the duration and number of retries for a temporary block should be linked to the service offered and trigger a fraud risk alert; and

(g)

the User is alerted before the block becomes permanent and a secure procedure is established to regain the use of the blocked payment instrument.
