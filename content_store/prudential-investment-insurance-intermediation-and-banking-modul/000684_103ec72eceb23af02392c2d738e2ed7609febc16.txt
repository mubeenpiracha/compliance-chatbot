Guidance

If the DFSA considers that an Authorised Firm has not carried out effective stress tests under Rules 9.2A.3 to 9.2A.5, it may use its power under Article 75A of the Regulatory Law to require the Authorised Firm to maintain a buffer of liquid assets in addition to that required under section 9.3.

Contingency Funding Plan

Guidance

A Contingency Funding Plan, or CFP, is a compilation of policies, procedures and action plans for responding to severe disruptions to an Authorised Firm’s ability to meet its liabilities as they fall due or its ability to fund some or all of its activities quickly and at a reasonable cost.

(1)

An Authorised Firm must have a documented Contingency Funding Plan (CFP) that sets out clearly its strategies for addressing liquidity shortfalls in emergency situations.

(2)

An Authorised Firm must ensure that its CFP is in writing and is approved by its Governing Body.

(3)

The CFP must be commensurate with an Authorised Firm’s complexity, risk profile and scope of operations and its role in the financial systems in which it operates.
