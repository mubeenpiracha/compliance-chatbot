The DFSA’s assessment of the individual risk profile of an Authorised Firm will provide the context for evaluation of the firm’s IRAP and/or ICAAP. The evaluation in turn will be used by the DFSA to augment its understanding of the overall risk profile of a firm. Also, the DFSA might involve such a firm in a formalised discussion of risks and capital adequacy, which might lead to a requirement for additional capital.

The SREP may be used as a regulatory tool for Authorised Firms which are required to perform an IRAP and/or ICAAP. The SREP for each Authorised Firm will be proportionate in terms of the size, scale and complexity of its business and its impact on financial sector stability. The DFSA will cooperate actively with other supervisory authorities whenever an Authorised Firm is part of a Group and is prudentially regulated on a consolidated basis.
