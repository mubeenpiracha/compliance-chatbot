Guidance

1.

In complying with Rule 6.12.2, an Authorised Firm should take out and maintain a contract for professional indemnity insurance (PII) from a reputable and well-capitalised insurer and such contract should include cover in respect of claims for which the Authorised Firm may be liable as a result of the conduct of itself and its Employees and appropriate cover in respect of legal costs arising from a claim.

2.

Pursuant to Rule 6.4.1(c), an Authorised Firm should notify the DFSA of any significant PII claim made. What amounts to a significant claim will depend on the nature size and complexity of the Authorised Firm and the DFSA would expect the Authorised Firm to treat a series of small single claims which are significant in aggregate as significant for the purposes of Rule 6.4.1(c).
