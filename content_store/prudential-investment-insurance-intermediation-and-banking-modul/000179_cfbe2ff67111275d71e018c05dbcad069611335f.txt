Recognition of eligible financial Collateral under FCSA

A4.3.10 Subject to A4.3.11, an Authorised Firm which has taken eligible financial Collateral for a CR Exposure and is using the FCSA may recognise the effects of Credit Risk mitigation of the eligible financial Collateral as follows:

(a) break down the Exposure into -

(i)

a collateralised portion with E equal to the latest fair value of the eligible financial Collateral; and

(ii)

an uncollateralised portion with E equal to the E of the CR Exposure less the latest fair value of the eligible financial Collateral;

and

(b)

for the purposes of calculating the Credit RWA amount pursuant to Rule 4.8.3, use:

(i)

for the collateralised portion, the CRW that is applicable to the eligible financial Collateral as though the Authorised Firm had a direct Exposure to that Collateral; and

(ii)

for the uncollateralised portion, the CRW that is applicable to the obligor.

A4.3.11 If the CRW determined in accordance with A4.3.10(b)(i) is less than 20%, an Authorised Firm must apply a CRW of 20% to the collateralised portion of the CR Exposure, except in the following cases:

(a) a qualifying SFT where the Counterparty in the transaction is a core market participant, in which case the Authorised Firm may apply a risk weight of 0%;

(b) a qualifying SFT where the Counterparty in the transaction is not a core market

participant, in which case the Authorised Firm may apply a risk weight of 10%;

(c)

a transaction where there is no currency mismatch and the Collateral comprises:

(i)

cash on deposit as set out in Rule 4.13.5(1)(a); or

(ii) Exposures to a central government, Central Bank or PSE, or a combination thereof, qualifying for a 0% risk weight under the Rules in section 4.12, and the latest fair value of such Collateral has been discounted by 20% for the purposes of determining the value of the collateralised portion of the CR Exposure in accordance with Rule A4.3.10(a)(i),

in which case the Authorised Firm may apply a CRW of 0%.

Guidance

An SFT is a qualifying SFT if the requirements in section A4.4 are met.

Recognition of eligible guarantees and eligible Credit Derivatives

A4.3.12 Where an Authorised Firm has an Exposure that is covered by an eligible guarantee or by an eligible Credit Derivative, the Authorised Firm may recognise the effect of Credit Risk mitigation as follows:

(1)

(a) break down the Exposure into -

(i)

a protected portion; and

(ii)

an unprotected portion;

and

(b)

for the purposes of calculating the Credit RWA amount pursuant to Rule 4.8.3, use:

(i)

for the protected portion, the CRW that is applicable to the protection provider as though the Authorised Firm had a direct Exposure to that provider; and

(ii)

for the unprotected portion, the CRW that is applicable to the obligor.

(2) Where a guarantee or Credit Derivative provides for a materiality threshold on payments below which no payment will be made in the event of loss, it is equivalent to a retained first loss position and must be deducted from the CET1 Capital.

(3) Where losses are shared pari passu on a pro rata basis between the Authorised Firm and the protection provider, the protected portion of the Exposure receives the treatment applicable to eligible guarantees or Credit Derivatives with the remainder treated as unprotected.

(4) Where an Authorised Firm transfers a part of the risk of an Exposure in one or

more tranches, the Rules in section 4.14 apply.
