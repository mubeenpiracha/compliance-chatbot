the following formula:

SCVAC =

1 α

RWC ∙ ∑MNS ∙ EADNS ∙ DFNS

NS

where:

RWC =

the risk weight for Counterparty ‘C’. Counterparty ‘C’ must be mapped to one of the risk weights based on a combination of sector and credit quality and determined in accordance with the table in Rule A5.10.6

NS =

the index that denotes all the netting sets with a given Counterparty

C =

the index that denotes all the Counterparties for which the firm uses BA- CVA its Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk Capital Requirement

to calculate

MNS =

the effective maturity for the netting set NS calculated as the weighted average remaining maturity of the exposures, where M is at least one year and the notional amount of each exposure is used for weighting the maturity

EADNS =

the exposure at default (EAD) of the netting set NS with Counterparty ‘C’, calculated in the same manner as the Authorised Firm calculates it for determining its Counterparty Credit Risk Capital Requirement under Rule 4.8.7

DFNS =

the supervisory discount factor, calculated as follows:

1 − e−0.05∙MNS 0.05 ∙ MNS
