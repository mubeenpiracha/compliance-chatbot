The distinguishing characteristic of these Exposures compared to other Regulatory Real Estate Exposures is that both the servicing of the loan and the prospects for recovery in the event of default depend materially on the cash flows generated by the property securing the Exposure.

The DFSA expects that the material dependence condition would predominantly apply to loans to corporates, SMEs or SPVs, but is not restricted to those borrower types. As an example, a loan may be considered materially dependent if more than 50% of the income from the borrower used in the Authorised Firm’s assessment of its ability to service the loan is from cash flows generated by the residential property.

(3) Where a party other than the Authorised Firm holds a senior lien and a junior lien by the Authorised Firm is recognised under Rule 4.12.20(c), the Authorised Firm must multiply the whole of the Regulatory Residential Real Estate Exposure risk weight determined under (1) and (2) respectively by 1.25, unless the LTV below or equal to 50%, in which case the Authorised Firm must not apply the multiplier.

(4) For the purpose of defining the LTV bucket in (3), the loan amount of the junior liens must include all other loans secured with liens of equal or higher ranking than the Authorised Firm’s lien. If there is insufficient information for ascertaining the ranking of the other liens, the Authorised Firm must rank the other liens pari passu with the junior lien held by it.
