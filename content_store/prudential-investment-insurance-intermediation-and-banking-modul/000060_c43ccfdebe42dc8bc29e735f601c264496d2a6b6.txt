 set out procedures that:

(i)

require such Exposures, and any write-off of such Exposures, exceeding specific amounts or otherwise posing special risks to the Authorised Firm, to be made subject to the prior written approval of the firm’s Governing Body or the Governing Body’s delegate; and

(ii)

exclude Persons directly or indirectly benefiting from the grant or write off of such Exposures being part of the approval process.

The prohibition in Rule 4.4.4(b) does not apply to providing credit to a Related Person under a credit policy on terms (such as for credit assessment, tenor, interest rates, amortisation schedules and requirements for Collateral) that are more favourable than those on which it provides credit to Persons who are not Related Persons, provided the credit policy:

(a)

is an Employee credit policy that is widely available to Employees of the Authorised Firm;

(b)

is approved by the Authorised Firm’s Governing Body or the Governing Body’s delegate;

(c)

clearly sets out the terms, conditions and limits (both at individual and aggregate levels) on which credit is to be provided to such Employees; and

(d)

requires adequate mechanisms to ensure on-going compliance with the terms and conditions of that credit policy, including immediate reporting to

the Governing Body or the Governing Body’s delegate where there is a deviation from or a breach of the terms and conditions or procedures applicable to the provision of such credit for timely and appropriate action.

Guidance

1.

The requirements in these Rules do not prevent arrangements such as Employee loan schemes that allow more favourable and flexible loan terms to Employees of the Authorised Firm than those available under its normal commercial arrangements. However, such a loan scheme must comply with the requirements set out in these Rules, which are designed to address conflicts of interest that may arise in the grant, approval or management of such loans. Such conflicts are especially likely to arise where one or more of the Employees concerned are Directors, Partners or senior managers.

2.

Generally, where an Authorised Firm has an Employee loan scheme under these Rules, the DFSA expects its Governing Body to have ensured, before it or its delegate approved that scheme, that the terms, conditions and particularly limits (both at individual and aggregate level) on which credit is to be provided to Employees under the scheme are adequate and effective in addressing the risks arising from such lending. The Authorised Firm should also be able to demonstrate to the DFSA that the procedures it has adopted relating to an Employee loan scheme are adequate to address any risks arising from such lending. The DFSA expects to have access to records relating to lending under an Employee loan scheme upon request or during its supervisory visits. Any significant breach of or deviation from the procedures adopted in relation to an Employee loan scheme may also trigger the reporting requirements to the DFSA under GEN Rule 11.10.7.

For the purposes of the Rules in this chapter, a Person is a “Related Person” of an Authorised Firm if the Person:

(a)

is, or was in the past 2 years:

(i)

a member of a Group or Partnership in which the Authorised Firm is or was also a member; or

(ii)

a Controller of the Authorised Firm or a Close Relative of such a Controller;

(b)

is, or was in the past 2 years, a Director, Partner or senior manager of the Authorised Firm or an entity referred to under (a)(i) or (ii), or a Close Relative of such a Director, Partner or senior manager; or

(c)

is an entity in which a Director, Partner or senior manager of the Authorised Firm or an entity referred to in (a)(i) or (a)(ii), or a Close Relative of such a Director, Partner or senior manager has a significant interest by:

(i)

holding 20% or more of the shares of that entity, or a Parent of that entity, if that entity is a company; or

(ii)

being entitled to exercise 20% or more of the voting rights in respect of that entity;

except that a Partner is not a Related Person where that Person is a limited partner of a Limited Partnership formed under the Limited Partnership Law of 200
