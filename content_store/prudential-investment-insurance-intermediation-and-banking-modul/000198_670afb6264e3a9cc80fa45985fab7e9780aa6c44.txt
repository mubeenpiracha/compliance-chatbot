Guidance

1.

An Authorised Firm is deemed to have effective control over the transferred Exposures if :

a.

it is able to repurchase from the transferee the previously transferred Exposures in order to realise their benefits; or

b.

it is obligated to retain the risk of the transferred Exposures.

2.

In this regard, an Authorised Firm acting as a Servicer in respect of the transferred Exposures will not necessarily constitute effective control of the Exposures.

3.

In respect of Rule A4.10.1(j), the amount of consideration received in the form of a fixed amount of Securities in the SPE would generally be regarded as meeting this requirement if the transaction is conducted at arm’s length and on market terms and conditions. Also, this requirement does not preclude excess cash from being channelled to the Authorised Firm after all claims connected with the Securities issued by the SPE have been paid out.

A4.10.2 An Authorised Firm which is an Originator or a Sponsor of a Synthetic Securitisation may recognise the credit protection obtained through the Synthetic Securitisation in its calculation of Credit RWA amounts only if all of the following conditions have been complied with:

(a)

significant Credit Risk associated with the underlying Exposures has been transferred from the Originator to third parties;

(b)

the instrument used to transfer the underlying Credit Risks must not contain terms or conditions that limit in any way the amount of Credit Risk transferred, including, but not limited to, clauses that:

(i) materially limit the credit protection or Credit Risk transference (e.g. significant materiality thresholds below which credit protection is deemed

not to be triggered even if a credit event occurs or those that allow for the termination of the protection due to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying Exposures);

(ii)

require the Authorised Firm to alter the underlying Exposures to improve the weighted average credit quality of the pool;

(iii)

increase the cost of credit protection to the Authorised Firm in response to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying Exposures;

(iv)

increase the yield payable to parties other than the Authorised Firm, such as investors and third-party providers of Credit Enhancements, in response to a deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying Exposures; or

(v)

provide for increases in a retained First Loss Position or Credit Enhancement provided by the originating bank after the transaction’s inception.

an Authorised Firm must provide an external legal opinion from a qualified legal counsel that confirms each of the points (i-v) and the enforceability of the contracts in all relevant jurisdictions;

where the assets relate to the Islamic Financial Business of an Authorised Firm, a written confirmation from the appointed Shari’a Supervisory Board that the securitisation complies with Shari’a;

where the securitisation includes a Clean-Up Call it must meet the requirements of Rule A4.10.3;

in the case where the risks associated with the underlying Exposures are transferred to an SPE:

(i)

the Securities issued by the SPE are not obligations of the Authorised Firm;

(ii)

the holders of the beneficial interests in that SPE have the right to pledge or exchange their interests without restriction; and

(iii)

the Authorised Firm holds not more than 20% of the aggregate original amount of all Securities issued by the SPE, except where such holdings consist entirely of Securities that have a Credit Quality Grade of 1 in accordance with Rules in sections 4.11 and 4.12, and all transactions with the SPE are conducted at arm’s length and on market terms and conditions;

the Authorised Firm has, on an on
