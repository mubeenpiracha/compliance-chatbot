This Guidance is merely an indicative list of risk categories, which does not preclude an Authorised Firm from assessing other risks that it considers significant (for example, securitisation risks and residual risks). Likewise, certain categories of risks might not be relevant to all Authorised Firms completing the IRAP. In this case, the IRAP should clearly indicate why the risk is considered minimal or not relevant. The IRAP should also consider all risks arising from any non-regulated activities of the Authorised Firm, if they are seen as material to the risk profile of the firm.
