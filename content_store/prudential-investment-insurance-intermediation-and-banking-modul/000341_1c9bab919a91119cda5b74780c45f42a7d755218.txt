Guidance

1.

As a consequence of Rule 4.12.2(1), an Authorised Firm may apply a 0% risk weight to an Exposure to a PSE referred to in Rule 4.12.3(2) if the PSE is incorporated in the U.A.E. and the Exposure is denominated and funded in the domestic currency of the U.A.E.

2.

The DFSA considers that under Rule 4.12.3(2) a PSE could qualify for the same treatment as claims on its central government if it has specific revenue-raising powers and has specific institutional arrangements the effect of which is to reduce its risk of default. Conversely, if a PSE does not have such arrangements or if strict lending rules apply and a declaration of bankruptcy is not possible because of its special public status, the PSE should be treated in accordance with Rule 4.12.3(1).

3.

A PSE will exhibit risk characteristics of a commercial enterprise under Rule 4.12.3(3), in particular, if the entity functions as a corporate in a competitive market even though the state, a regional authority or a local authority is a majority shareholder.
