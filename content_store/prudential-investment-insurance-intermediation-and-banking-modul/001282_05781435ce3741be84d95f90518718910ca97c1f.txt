The SREP evaluation cycle will be determined in the discretion of the DFSA and be based on the risk assessment, developments in the risk profile and changes in the Authorised Firmâ€™s strategy or products. The SREP is as far as possible aligned with the risk assessment process to ensure that a recent risk assessment is available for the SREP evaluation process.

It is envisaged that the DFSA will use a range of supervisory tools of qualitative or quantitative nature to perform the SREP. The SREP is not intended as, and should not constitute, a parallel or secondary IRAP or ICAAP. Its purpose is to evaluate the quality, completeness and consistency of the IRAP or ICAAP of the Authorised Firm.
