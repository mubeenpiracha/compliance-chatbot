In relation to establishing and maintaining a robust Operational Risk framework, an Authorised Firm’s senior management should:

a.

translate the Operational Risk management framework established by the Governing Body into specific policies and procedures that can be implemented and verified within the different business units;

b.

clearly assign authority, responsibility and reporting relationships to encourage and maintain accountability, and to ensure that the necessary resources are available to manage Operational Risk in line within the Authorised Firm’s risk appetite and tolerance; and

c.

ensure that the management oversight process is appropriate for the risks inherent in a business unit’s activity.

Risk identification and assessment

An Authorised Firm must:

(a)

ensure that it identifies and assesses the Operational Risks inherent in all the Authorised Firm’s products, activities, processes and systems;

(b)

ensure the inherent risks in (a) are understood by relevant Employees of the Authorised Firm;

(c)

systematically track Operational Risk events and any financial impact associated with such events; and

(d)

ensure that the tracking in (c) is consistent with the Operational Risk event types described in the Basel III framework.

Guidance

1.

An Authorised Firm should record all Operational Risk events, including near misses and events which result in a positive financial outcome.

An Authorised Firm must ensure that its Operational Risk policy in Rule 6.2.1:

(a)

includes an approval process for all new products, activities, processes and systems; and

(b)

incorporates the requirement in Rule 6.3.1(a).

Guidance

1.

An Authorised Firm should have policies and procedures that address the process for review and approval of new products, activities, processes and systems. The review and approval process should include consideration of:

a.

inherent risks in any new product, service, or activity;

b.

resulting changes to the Authorised Firm’s Operational Risk profile, appetite and tolerance, including changes to the risk of existing products or activities;

c.

necessary controls, risk management processes, and risk mitigation strategies;

d.

residual risk;

e.

changes to relevant risk limits;

f.

procedures and metrics to measure, monitor, and manage the risk of the new product or activity; and

g.

appropriate investment in human resources and technology infrastructure.

2.

Tools that an Authorised Firm may employ for identifying and assessing Operational Risk include:

a.

internal loss data collection and analysis;

Risk monitoring and reporting

An Authorised Firm must:

(a)

regularly monitor material Exposures to Operational Risk losses;

(b)

ensure that appropriate reporting mechanisms are in place at its Governing Body, senior management, and business line levels to support effective management of the Authorised Firm’s Operational Risk; and

(c)

immediately notify the DFSA of any material Operational Risk event including notification of any resulting financial impact, positive or negative, associated with such event.

Guidance

1.

GEN Rule 5.3.17 requires an Authorised Person to establish and maintain arrangements to provide its Governing Body and senior management with the information necessary to organise and control its activities, to comply with legislation applicable in the DIFC and to manage risks.

2.

Rule 6.4.1 is intended to complement GEN Rule 5.3.17 and requires Authorised Firms to establish and maintain reporting mechanisms specifically addressing the Operational Risk matters.

3.

The frequency of internal reporting of Operational Risks required by Rule 6.4.1(b) should reflect the risks involved and the pace and nature of changes in the Authorised Firm’s operating environment.
