A4.3.8 Under the following circumstances, an Authorised Firm must apply a higher minimum

holding period:

(a)

for a Netting Set consisting of more than 5,000 transactions, the minimum holding period of risk is 20 business days;

(b)

for a Netting Set containing one or more transactions involving either illiquid Collateral or an OTC derivative that cannot be easily replaced, the minimum holding period of risk is 20 business days; and

(c)

if an Authorised Firm has experienced more than two margin call disputes on a particular Netting Set over the previous two quarters that have lasted longer than the applicable minimum holding period (before consideration of this provision), the Authorised Firm must use a minimum holding period that is at least double the supervisory floor for that netting set for the subsequent two quarters.

A4.3.9 Where the assumed minimum holding period is not met or remargining or revaluation conditions are not fulfilled, an Authorised Firm must calculate the applicable haircut, H, using the following formula:

H = H10√

NR + (Tmin − 1) 10

where:

H10 =

ten business-day haircut for Collateral

NR =

actual number of business days between remargining or revaluation, as applicable

Tmin =

the minimum holding period for the type of transaction, determined in accordance with Rules A4.3.7 and A4.3.8
