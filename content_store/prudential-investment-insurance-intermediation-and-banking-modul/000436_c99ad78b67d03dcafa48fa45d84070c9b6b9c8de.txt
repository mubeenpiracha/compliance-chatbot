Guidance

Currency mismatches are allowed under all approaches. Under the FCSA there is no specific treatment for currency mismatches, given that a minimum risk weight of 20% (floor) is generally applied.

Maturity mismatches

4.13.14 (1)

Subject to (2), an Authorised Firm may recognise the effects of Credit Risk mitigation for an Exposure where there is a maturity mismatch only if the Credit Risk mitigant has an Original Maturity of at least one year and a residual maturity of at least three months. For the purposes of calculating Credit RWA, a maturity mismatch occurs when the residual maturity of the Credit Risk mitigant is less than that of the underlying Exposure.

(2)

An Authorised Firm using FCSA must not recognise the effects of Credit Risk mitigation of any Collateral with a maturity mismatch.

4.13.15 (1)

An Authorised Firm must determine the maturity of the underlying Exposure and the maturity of the Credit Risk mitigant conservatively. The residual maturity of the underlying Exposure must be gauged as the longest possible remaining time before the Counterparty is scheduled to fulfil its obligation, taking into account any applicable grace period.
