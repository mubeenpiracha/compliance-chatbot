Guidance

1.

In A6.1.1(1), the three year average should be calculated on the basis of the last three yearly observations at the end of the Authorised Firmâ€™s financial year. When audited figures are not available, business estimates may be used.

2.

If an Authorised Firm does not have sufficient income data to meet the three year requirement (e.g. a start-up), it may use its forecasted gross income projections for all or part of the three year time period. For example, if an Authorised Firm has two positive yearly gross incomes of USD 20 each and the final yearly observation shows a negative figure of USD 5, then the average should be calculated as USD 20 being USD 40 (sum of positive figures) divided by 2 (number of years for which positive figures are available).

3.

Net interest income in A6.1.1(4) is the interest income minus interest expense. Guidance on what constitutes interest income and interest expense can be found in the PRU module.
