Purpose and process of the ICAAP

2.

The ICAAP is an internal process of an Authorised Firm which enables it to determine and maintain the amount and quality of capital that is adequate in relation to the Authorised Firm’s risk profile as assessed in the IRAP. Authorised Firms are encouraged to maintain capital over and above the regulatory minimum capital. The ICAAP, in conjunction with the IRAP, should be embedded in the Authorised Firm’s business and organisational processes.

3. When assessing its capital needs, an Authorised Firm should take into account the impact of economic cycles, and sensitivity to other external risks and factors. For larger or more complex institutions, this may mean developing an appropriate stress testing and scenario testing framework. The DFSA does not prescribe any specific approach for the ICAAP and, consequently, an Authorised Firm can choose to implement an ICAAP which is proportionate to the nature, size and complexity of the business activities.
