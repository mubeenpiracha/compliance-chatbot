 to meet a Capital Buffer Requirement

Guidance

This section sets out measures that an Authorised Firm must take if it is not meeting a Capital Buffer Requirement, i.e. its Capital Conservation Buffer Requirement, CCyB Requirement or HLA Capital Buffer Requirement. The measures, such as not distributing capital and preparing a plan to restore capital, do not limit other action that the DFSA may take against the firm for failing to meet the requirement.

3.9C.1 This section applies to an Authorised Firm in Category 1, 2 (other than a Matched

Principal) or 5.

Restrictions on distributions

3.9C.2 Where an Authorised Firm fails to meet a Capital Buffer Requirement, it must:

(a)

calculate the maximum distributable amount in accordance with Rule 3.9C.5;

(b)

ensure that it does not undertake any of the following actions until it has calculated the maximum distributable amount and notified the DFSA under Rule 3.9C.6:

(i) make a distribution in connection with CET1 Capital;

(ii)

create an obligation to pay variable remuneration or discretionary pension benefits or pay variable remuneration if the obligation to pay was created at a time when the institution failed to meet a Capital Buffer Requirement; or

(iii) make payments on AT1 and T2 Capital instruments.

3.9C.3 An Authorised Firm must:

(1)

in subsequently taking any of the actions described in Rule 3.9C.2(b)(i) to (iii), ensure that it distributes no more than its calculated maximum distributable amount; and

(2)

prepare and submit a capital conservation plan pursuant to Rule 3.9C.8.

3.9C.4 For the purposes of Rule 3.9C.2(b)(i), a distribution in connection with CET1 Capital

includes any of the following:

(a)

payment of cash dividends;

(b)

distribution of fully or partly paid bonus shares or other capital instruments;

(c)

a redemption or purchase by an institution of its own shares or other capital instruments;

(d)

a repayment of amounts paid up in connection with capital; or

(e)

a distribution of other items referred to in section 3.13 as eligible for inclusion as CET1 Capital.

3.9C.5 (1)

In this section, a reference to a “maximum distributable amount” means the maximum amount that an Authorised Firm may distribute in connection with CET1 Capital as specified in Rules 3.9C.2 and 3.9C.3.

(2)

Subject to (3), an Authorised Firm must determine the maximum distributable amount by multiplying the sum specified in (a) by the factor determined under (b):

(a)

the total of interim or year-end profits that were not included in CET1 Capital pursuant to Rule 3.13.2 and which have accrued after the most recent distribution of profits and after any of the actions referred to in Rule 3.9C.2(b);

(b) where the CET1 Capital of the Authorised Firm (which is not used to meet the Capital Requirement), expressed as a percentage of the firm’s RWA, is:

(i) within the first quartile (0%-25%) of its Capital Buffer, the factor

is 0;

(ii) within the second quartile (25%-50%) of its Capital Buffer, the

factor is 0.2;

(iii) within the third quartile (50%-75%) of its Capital Buffer, the factor

is 0.4; and

(iv) within the fourth quartile (75%-100%) of its Capital Buffer, the

factor is 0.6.

(3)

If an Authorised Firm undertakes any action under Rule 3.9C.2(b), it must take that into account and reduce the maximum distributable amount accordingly.

3.9C.6 For the purpose of Rule 3.9C.2(b), where an Authorised Firm intends to distribute any of its distributable profits or intends to undertake an action referred to in Rule 3.9C.2(b)(i) to (iii), the Authorised Firm must
