c.

For an Authorised Firm to undertake such a transaction there should be existing positions in the Trading Book, which result in a sufficient General Market Risk requirement to offset the General Market Risk created as a result of the swap.

A2.1.14 Appropriate documentation under A2.1.13 must cover:

(a)

details of the instruments or Exposures being transferred and the method used to transfer; and

(b)

the pricing of the transfer.

Guidance

1.

Separate documentation need not be produced for every transfer. If the same method is used for a number of transfers, a single document detailing the procedures will suffice. However, an Authorised Firm must still be able to distinguish transactions that have been undertaken for risk transfer purposes from other transactions.

2.

Arm’s-length prices must be used in any transfer. ‘Arm’s-length’ means the prevailing market price for the particular transaction.
