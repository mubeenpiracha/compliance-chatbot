The notional amount of an off-balance sheet item refers to the amount which has been committed but is as yet undrawn. The amount to which the CCF is applied is the lower of the value of the unused committed credit line, and the value which reflects any possible constraining availability of the facility, such as the existence of a ceiling on the potential lending amount which is related to an obligorâ€™s reported cash flow. If the facility is constrained in this way, the Authorised Firm must have sufficient line monitoring and management procedures to support this contention.
