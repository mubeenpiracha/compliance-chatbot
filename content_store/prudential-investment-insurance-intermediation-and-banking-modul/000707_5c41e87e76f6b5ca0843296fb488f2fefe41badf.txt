SUPERVISORY REVIEW AND EVALUATION PROCESSES

Introduction

Guidance

1.

This chapter deals with the regulatory requirements arising out of the need for Authorised Firms to carry out a self-assessment of their risk which can be reviewed and assessed by the regulator. This chapter details the Rules stipulating the need to complete internal risk assessments by Authorised Firms in defined frequencies and the DFSAâ€™s role in reviewing the results of such assessments. In the case of Authorised Firms facing financial risks, the requirements in this chapter mandate completion of an internal capital adequacy assessment process. The DFSA will review the results of such internal risk assessments. This chapter also sets out how the DFSA may impose an additional capital requirement on a firm-specific basis in addition to the minimum requirement specified in chapter 3 of this module.
