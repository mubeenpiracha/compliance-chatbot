Guidance

For the purposes of Rule 7.2.1, an Authorised Firm should consider each currency accounting for 5% or more of its Non-Trading Book assets or Non-Trading book liabilities as a material currency Exposure.

Frequency of stress testing

An Authorised Firm must carry out the evaluations required by Rule 7.2.1 as frequently as necessary for it to be reasonably satisfied that it has at all times a sufficient understanding of the degree to which it is exposed to the risks referred to in that Rule and the nature of that Exposure. In any case it must carry out those evaluations no less frequently than required by Rule 7.2.6.

In order to carry out effectively the stress testing requirements specified in Rule 7.2.2, an Authorised Firm must include appropriate scenarios into its stress testing programmes for measuring its vulnerability to loss arising from the impact of adverse interest rate movements on its Non-Trading Book structure.

(1)

Subject to (2), the minimum frequency of the evaluation referred to in Rule 7.2.1 is once each year.
