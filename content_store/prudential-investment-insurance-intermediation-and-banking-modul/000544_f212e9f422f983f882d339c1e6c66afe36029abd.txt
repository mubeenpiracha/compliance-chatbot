In addition to value-at-risk models, the DFSA recognises option risk aggregation models and interest rate ‘pre-processing’ or sensitivity models, as set out under the EU’s Capital Adequacy Directive (these are the so-called ‘CAD1 models’).

Option risk aggregation models analyse and aggregate options risks for interest rate, equity, foreign exchange and commodity options.

Interest rate pre-processing models are used to calculate weighted positions for inclusion in an Authorised Firm’s interest rate Market Risk Capital Requirement calculation under the Duration Method.
