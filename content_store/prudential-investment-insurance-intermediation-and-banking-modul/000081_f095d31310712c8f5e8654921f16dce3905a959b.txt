.4.2; and

(f)

all the information required at origination of the Exposure and for monitoring purposes is properly documented, including information on the ability of the borrower to repay and on the valuation of the property.

4.12.21 For the purpose of Rules 4.12.23 and 4.12.24, an Authorised Firm must calculate the loan-to-value (LTV) by dividing the loan amount by the value of the property in accordance with the following requirements:

(a)

the value of the property must be equal to the value measured at origination unless any of the below applies:

(i)

if an extraordinary, idiosyncratic event occurs that results in a permanent reduction of value of the property, the Authorised Firm must, within a reasonable time, obtain an updated valuation and the value of the property is the value shown by the updated valuation;

(ii)

if modifications are made to the property that unequivocally increase its value, and an updated valuation confirms the increase, the Authorised Firm may use the value shown by the updated valuation;

(b)

the LTV must be calculated prudently in accordance with the following requirements:

(i)

the amount of the loan must include the outstanding loan amount and any undrawn committed amount of the mortgage loan, without taking into account credit risk adjustments and other capital deductions or any form of credit risk mitigation except for pledged deposit accounts with the Authorised firm that meet all requirements for on-balance sheet netting in accordance with Rules 4.13.17 to 4.13.19 and have been unconditionally and irrevocably pledged for the sole purposes of payment of the mortgage loan;

(ii)

the value of the immovable property must be appraised independently from the Authorised Firm’s mortgage acquisition, loan processing and loan decision process, using prudently conservative valuation criteria. The valuation must:

(A) exclude expectations on price increases;

(B) be adjusted to take into account the potential for the current market price to be significantly above the value that would be sustainable over the life of the loan;

(C) where a market value can be determined, not be higher than the

market value; and

PRUDENTIAL – INVESTMENT, INSURANCE INTERMEDIATION AND BANKING (PIB)

(D) where the loan is financing the purchase of the property, not be

higher than the effective purchase price;

(c)

the value of the property must not depend materially on the performance of the borrower.

4.12.22 (1) Subject to (2), for the purpose of Rules 4.12.23 to 4.12.25, a Real Estate Exposure is materially dependent on the cash flows generated by the property if the payment of the loan materially depends on the cash flows generated by the property securing the Exposure, rather than on the underlying capacity of the borrower to service the loan from other sources.

(2) A Regulatory Real Estate Exposure is not materially dependent on the cash

flows generated by the property if it is:

(a)

secured by a property which is the borrower’s primary residence;

(b) an Exposure secured by an income-producing residential housing unit to an individual who has no more than two other mortgaged properties or housing units, to an individual;

(c)

secured by a Residential Real Estate Exposure to associations or cooperatives of individuals that are regulated under national law and exist with the only purpose of granting its members the use of a primary residence in the property securing the loans; or

(d)

secured by Residential Real Estate to public housing companies and not- for-profit associations regulated under national law that exist to serve social purposes and to offer tenants long-term housing.

Guidance

1.

The primary source of the cash flows generated by a property are generally lease or rental payments or the sale of the property. The distinguishing characteristic of these Exposures compared to other Regulatory Real Estate Exposures is that both the servicing of the loan and the prospects for recovery in the event of default depend materially on the cash flows generated by the property securing the Exposure.

2.

The DFSA expects that the material dependence condition would predominantly apply to loans to corporates, SMEs or SPVs, but is not restricted to those borrower types. As an example, a loan may be considered materially dependent if more than 50% of the income from the borrower used in the Authorised Firm’s assessment
