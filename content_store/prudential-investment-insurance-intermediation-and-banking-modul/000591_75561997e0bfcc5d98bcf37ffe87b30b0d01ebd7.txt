2. An Authorised Firm should, as best practice in maintaining the integrity of User security credentials (USC), endeavour:

(a) not to allow the USC to be fully readable when inputted by the User or by its own staff;

(b)

to ensure that the USC always remain encrypted and no information relating to the USC is stored in plain text;

(c)

to protect secret cryptographic material from unauthorised disclosure;

(d)

to document the process used to encrypt or otherwise render the USCs unreadable;

(e)

to adopt measures to mitigate the risk of unauthorised use of compromised USCs;

(f)

to ensure secure delivery of the USC to the User, secure association of the USC with the User and the secure disposal of the USC once it is obsolete; and

(g)

to immediately inform the User and the issuer of the USC (if another firm) in the event a USC is compromised under the firm's sphere of control.
