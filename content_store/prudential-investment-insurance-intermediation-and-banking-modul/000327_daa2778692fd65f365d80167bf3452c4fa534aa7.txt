4.9.12 An SFT must be treated as Collateralised lending, notwithstanding the wide range of

structures which could be used for SFTs.

4.9.13 An Authorised Firm must calculate E, for a Counterparty Exposure arising from an SFT, other than an Exposure covered by a Qualifying Bilateral Netting Agreement, in accordance with Rules 4.9.14 to 4.9.18.

4.9.14 An Authorised Firm must determine E, for a Counterparty Exposure arising from an

SFT which is not covered by a Qualifying Bilateral Netting Agreement as follows:

(a)

in the case where the Authorised Firm has lent Securities to a Counterparty or sold Securities to a Counterparty with a commitment to repurchase those Securities at a specified price on a specified future date, the latest fair value of the Securities lent or sold; and

(b)

in the case where the Authorised Firm has lent cash to a Counterparty through the borrowing of Securities from the Counterparty or paid cash for the purchase of Securities from a Counterparty with a commitment to resell those Securities at a specified price on a specified future date, the amount of cash lent or paid.
