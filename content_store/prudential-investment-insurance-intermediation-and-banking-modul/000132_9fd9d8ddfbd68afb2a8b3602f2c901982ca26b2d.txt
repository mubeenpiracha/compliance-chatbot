Guidance

1.

An Authorised Firm should refer to chapters 4, 5 and 6 to determine whether it is required to calculate a Credit Risk Capital Requirement (also referred to in this module as CRCOM), a Market Risk Capital Requirement or an Operational Risk Capital Requirement, respectively.

2.

An Authorised Firm will also need to consider the relevant provisions in IFR chapter 5 when calculating its Credit Risk and Market Risk for Islamic Contracts.

3.

If the DFSA imposes an Individual Capital Requirement on an Authorised Firm under chapter 10, such a requirement is additional to the Risk Capital Requirement and is, therefore, a component of the Authorised Firms Capital Requirement.
