Guidance

The Schedule 3 procedures and the right of review by the FMT do not apply to the designation of a G- SIB under Rule 1.4.1 (see Rule 1.4.4(5)). This is because the DFSA, under Rule 1.4.1, will designate a bank as a G-SIB if it is included on the list of global systemically important banks published by the Financial Stability Board.
