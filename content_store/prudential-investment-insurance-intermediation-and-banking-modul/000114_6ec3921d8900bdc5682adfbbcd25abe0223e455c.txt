Guidance

1.

The Authorised Firm should ensure that the level of aggregate risk that it is willing to assume allows it to manage its risks prudently in normal times and in a way that allows it to withstand periods of stress. The level of aggregate risk should include both quantitative and qualitative elements, as appropriate, and encompass a range of measures. These should be expressed in terms that are clear enough for all levels of management to be able to understand the trade-off between risks and profits.

2.

The DFSA expects that the risk appetite statement also outlines actions to be taken when risk limits are breached, including disciplinary actions for excessive risk-taking, escalation procedures and Governing Body notification.

3.

For an Authorised Firm that is a Branch the capital and liquidity position referred to in Rule 2.5.1(2)(b) should be determined in accordance with Rule 3.2.4(a).
