Simplified Framework

A5.2.16 In applying the simplified framework, an Authorised Firm must calculate its General

Market Risk requirement for each currency by taking the following steps:

(a)

allocating the individual net positions to one of the time bands in the table below, as follows:

(i)

fixed-rate instruments are allotted their time bands based upon the residual time to maturity; and

(ii)

floating-rate instruments are allocated to time bands based upon the time remaining to the re-determination of the coupon;

(b)

adding the market values of the individual net positions within each band irrespective of whether they are long or short positions to produce a gross position figure;

(c)

multiplying the amount in (b) by the risk percentage for the relevant maturity band in the table below; and

(d)

adding the calculations in (c) to arrive at the General Market Risk requirement.
