commodities x Delta

A5.6.8

In addition to the capital charges referred to in Rule A5.6.5, arising from Delta risk, an Authorised Firm must calculate the Gamma for each option position, including hedge positions in the following way:

(a)

for each individual option a “Gamma impact” must be calculated as:

Gamma impact = ½ x Gamma x VU²

where VU = Variation of the underlying instrument of the option;

(b)

(i)

for interest rate options if the underlying instrument is a bond, the market value of the underlying instrument should be multiplied by the risk weights set out in section 5.4 for the underlying instrument. An equivalent calculation should be carried out where the underlying instrument is an interest rate, again based on the assumed changes in the corresponding yield in Rule A5.2.16;
