Securitisation, Synthetic Securitisation and Re-securitisation, as defined below:

(a)

A Traditional Securitisation is a structure where the cash flow from an underlying pool of Exposures is used to service at least two different stratified risk positions or tranches reflecting different degrees of Credit Risk. Payments to the investors depend upon the performance of the specified underlying Exposures, as opposed to being derived from an obligation of the entity originating those Exposures. A Traditional Securitisation will generally assume the movement of assets off balance sheet.

(b)

A Synthetic Securitisation is a structure with at least two different stratified risk positions or tranches that reflect different degrees of Credit Risk where Credit Risk of an underlying pool of Exposures is transferred, in whole or in part, through the use of funded (e.g. credit-linked notes) or unfunded (e.g. credit default swaps) Credit Derivatives or guarantees that serve to hedge the Credit Risk of the portfolio. Accordingly, the investors’ potential risk is dependent upon the performance of the underlying pool. A Synthetic Securitisation may or may not involve the removal of assets off balance sheet.

(c)

A Re-securitisation Exposure is a securitisation Exposure in which the associated underlying pool of Exposures is tranched and at least one of the underlying Exposures is a securitisation Exposure. In addition, an Exposure to one or more Re-securitisation Exposures is a Re-securitisation Exposure.

Guidance

The DFSA would treat other techniques to achieve the financing or re-financing of assets which are legally transferred to a scheme, by packaging them into a tradable form through the issue of Securities which are secured on the assets and serviced from the cashflows which they yield as “securitisation”.

Systems and controls for the use of securitisations

4.14.3 An Authorised Firm must implement and maintain appropriate risk management systems to identify, manage, monitor and, where applicable, control all risks in

PRUDENTIAL – INVESTMENT, INSURANCE INTERMEDIATION AND BANKING (PIB)

relation to a securitisation transaction whether the firm is an investor, Originator or Sponsor. In particular, such risk management systems should effectively address the following risks:

(a)

the liquidity and capital implications that may arise from the items returning to the balance sheet;

(b)

the Operational Risks that may arise under a securitisation; and

(c)

reputational risks that may arise as a result of its securitisation activities.

4.14.4 An Authorised Firm must have appropriate policies and procedures to ensure that the economic substance of the transaction is fully reflected in the process of managing the risks arising from such transactions. An Authorised Firm must have appropriate policies and procedures in place to document its systems and controls in relation to securitisation risks. These policies should include details on the capital effects of the securitisation as set out in this chapter.

4.14.5 An Authorised Firm must conduct periodic stress tests in relation to its securitisation activities and off balance sheet Exposures, including testing of future ability to transact securitisation as a means of Credit Risk mitigation or for liquidity purposes.

Guidance

1.

The periodic stress testing in relation to securitisation activities referred to in Rule 4.14.5 should consider the firm-wide impact of those activities and Exposures in stressed market conditions and the implications for other sources of risk. Such stress tests should include both existing securitisation Exposures and transactions in the pipeline, as there is a risk of the pipeline transactions not being completed in a stressed market scenario.

2.

The frequency and extent of stress testing to fulfil the requirements of Rule 4.14.5 should be determined on the basis of the materiality of the Authorised Firm’s securitisation volumes and its off-balance sheet Exposures.

3.

An Authorised Firm should have procedures in place to assess and respond to the results produced from the stress testing and these should be taken into account under the ICAAP.
