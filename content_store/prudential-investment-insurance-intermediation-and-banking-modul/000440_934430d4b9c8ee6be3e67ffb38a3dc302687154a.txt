On-balance sheet Netting

4.13.17 (1)

An Authorised Firm may recognise as eligible the Netting of an on-balance sheet Exposure against an offsetting on-balance sheet item if the related Netting agreement meets the condition in Rule 4.13.19.

(2)

Eligibility for Netting is limited to reciprocal cash balances between the Authorised Firm and its Counterparty. Only loans and deposits of the Authorised Firm may be subject to a modification of their Credit RWAs as a result of an on-balance sheet Netting agreement.

4.13.18 (1)

Assets (loans) and liabilities (deposits) subject to recognised on-balance sheet Netting are to be treated as cash Collateral using the formula in A4.3.6, under which an Authorised Firm may use zero haircuts for Exposure and Collateral.

(2)

When a currency mismatch exists, an Authorised Firm must apply the standard supervisory haircut of 8% for currency mismatch.

(3)

When a maturity mismatch exists between the off-setting items, an Authorised Firm must apply the Rules 4.13.14 to 4.13.16 to address the maturity mismatch.
