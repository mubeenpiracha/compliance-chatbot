Recognition of eligible financial Collateral under FCSA Approach

4.14.70 An Authorised Firm which has taken eligible financial Collateral for an SE Exposure and is using the FCSA may recognise the effect of the eligible financial Collateral as follows:

(a)

break down the SE Exposure into:

(i)

a collateralised portion with E equal to the latest fair market value of the eligible financial Collateral; and

(ii)

an uncollateralised portion whose Exposure value equals the E of the SE Exposure less the latest fair market value of the eligible financial Collateral; and

(b)

apply the CRW that is applicable to the eligible financial Collateral to the collateralised portion calculated in accordance with (a)(i) to calculate the Credit RWA amount of the collateralised portion as though the Authorised Firm had a direct Exposure to the eligible financial Collateral; and

(c)

either:

(i)

apply the CRW that is applicable to the SE Exposure to the uncollateralised portion calculated in accordance with (a)(ii) to calculate the Credit RWA amount of the uncollateralised portion; or

(ii)

include the uncollateralised portion as a deduction from CET1 Capital.

Guidance

Collateral in the context of a SE Exposure refers to assets used to hedge the Credit Risk of a securitisation Exposure rather than the underlying Exposures of the securitisation, including Collateral pledged by an SPE.

4.14A Counterparty Credit Risk

4.14A.1 This section applies to Exposures in the Trading Book and the Non-Trading Book that give rise to Counterparty Credit Risk and that are not cleared through a CCP, including the following transactions:

(a) OTC derivatives;

(b) exchange-traded derivatives; and

(c)

long settlement transactions;

but excluding:

(d) SFTs.

Guidance

1.

Transactions that give rise to Counterparty Credit Risk exhibit the following abstract characteristics. The transactions:

a.

generate a current exposure or market value;

b.

have an associated random future market value based on market variables;

c.

generate an exchange of payments or an exchange of a financial instrument (including commodities) against payment; and

d.

are undertaken with an identified counterparty against which a unique probability of default can be determined.

2.

Other common characteristics of the transactions in Rule 4.14A.1 include the following:

a.

Collateral may be used to mitigate risk exposure and is inherent in the nature of some transactions;

b.

short-term financing may be a primary objective in that the transactions mostly consist of an exchange of one asset for another (cash or securities) for a relatively short period of time, usually for the business purpose of financing; the two sides of the transactions are not the result of separate decisions but form an indivisible whole to accomplish a defined objective;

c.
