An Authorised Firm must provide to the DFSA, if requested, any of the following information in relation to its Group or Financial Group:

(a) details as to the entities within the Group or Financial Group;

(b)

the structure of the Group or Financial Group; and

Guidance

1.

If more than one member of the same Group is subject to an obligation to provide information in respect of a position of the Group or Financial Group, one or more of those Authorised Firms may make application to the DFSA for an appropriate waiver or modification.

2.

For the purposes of Rule 8.1.2, the DFSA would consider a range of factors when requiring an Authorised Firm to form a Financial Group. These factors would include regulatory risk factors, including but not limited to, (direct and indirect) participation, influence or contractual obligations, interconnectedness, intra group exposures, intra group services, regulatory status and legal framework.

Systems and controls requirements

An Authorised Firm in Category 1, 2 (other than a Matched Principal) or 5 that is a member of a Group must establish and maintain systems and controls for the purpose of:

(a)

monitoring the effect on the Authorised Firm of:

(i)

its relationship with other members of its Group;

(ii)

its membership in its Group; and

(iii)

the activities of other members of its Group;

(b)

monitoring compliance with Financial Group supervision requirements below, including systems for the production of relevant data;

(c)

monitoring funding within the Group; and

(d)

monitoring compliance with Financial Group reporting requirements.

Guidance

For the purposes of the above requirement, an Authorised Firm may take into account its position within its Group. For instance, it would be reasonable for a small Authorised Firm within a larger Group to place some reliance on its parent to ensure that appropriate systems and controls are in place.

(1)

An Authorised Firm must have systems and controls to enable it to determine and monitor:

(c)

except where the DFSA has directed the inclusion of an entity pursuant to Rule 8.1.2, the percentage of total assets of Authorised Firms and Financial Institutions in the Financial Group is less than 40% of the total Financial Group assets.

If an Authorised Firm receives confirmation in writing from the DFSA in accordance with (1)(b), it must immediately advise the DFSA in writing if the circumstances upon which the confirmation was based change.
