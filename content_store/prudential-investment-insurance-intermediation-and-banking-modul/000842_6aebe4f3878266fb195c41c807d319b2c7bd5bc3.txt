Guidance

In cases where there is an undertaking to provide a commitment on another off-balance sheet Exposure, an Authorised Firm should apply the lower of the applicable CCFs. For example, if an Authorised Firm has a commitment to open self-liquidating trade letters of credit arising from the movement of goods, in particular documentary credits collateralised by the underlying shipment with an Original Maturity of less than one year, a 20% CCF should be applied instead of a 40% CCF.
