Guidance

1.

For the purposes of the Alternative Standardised Approach, total loans and advances in the retail banking business line consist of the total drawn amounts in the following credit portfolios: retail, SMEs treated as retail, and purchased retail receivables.

2.

For commercial banking, total loans and advances consist of the drawn amounts in the following credit portfolios: corporate, sovereign, bank, specialised lending, SMEs treated as corporate and purchased corporate receivables. The book value of securities held in the Non-Trading Book should also be included.

3.

The three year average should be calculated on the basis of the last three yearly observations at the end of the Authorised Firmâ€™s financial year. When audited figures are not available, business estimates may be used.

4.

If an Authorised Firm does not have sufficient income data to meet the three year requirement (e.g. a start-up) it may use its forecasted gross income projections for all or part of the three year time period.
