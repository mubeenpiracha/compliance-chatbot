Categories of Authorised Firms

Guidance

1.

Authorised Firms are divided into Categories to provide a clear framework for determining which specific Rules in PIB apply to each Authorised Firm. The Rules in this section enable an Authorised Firm to determine into which Category it falls.

2.

The table in A1.1 of App1sets out the categorisation process diagrammatically. In that table, an emboldened box indicates the Financial Service that is determinative of the Category into which an Authorised Firm falls. An Authorised Firm may, if authorised under its Licence to do so, conduct any number of Financial Services specified under any lower Category than the one that applies to the Authorised Firm in accordance with this section (For this purpose Category 5 is considered to be equivalent to Category 1). For example, a Category 1 firm could conduct any of the Financial Services specified under Categories 2, 3A, 3B, 3C, 3D or 4 (if authorised to do
