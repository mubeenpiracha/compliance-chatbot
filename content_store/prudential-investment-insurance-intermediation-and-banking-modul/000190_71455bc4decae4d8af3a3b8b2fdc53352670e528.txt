Guidance

The calculation of the add-on for the equity asset class is very similar to the calculation of the add-on for the credit asset class. It only gives full recognition of the offsetting of long and short positions for derivatives that reference the same entity (e.g. the same corporate issuer of shares). Partial offsetting is recognised between derivatives that reference different entities.

Add-on for transactions in the commodity asset class

commodity asset class, AddOnj
