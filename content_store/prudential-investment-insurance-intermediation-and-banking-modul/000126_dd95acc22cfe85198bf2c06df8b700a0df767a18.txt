 no information relating to the USC is stored in plain text;

(c)

to protect secret cryptographic material from unauthorised disclosure;

(d)

to document the process used to encrypt or otherwise render the USCs unreadable;

(e)

to adopt measures to mitigate the risk of unauthorised use of compromised USCs;

(f)

to ensure secure delivery of the USC to the User, secure association of the USC with the User and the secure disposal of the USC once it is obsolete; and

(g)

to immediately inform the User and the issuer of the USC (if another firm) in the event a USC is compromised under the firm's sphere of control.

3. Dynamic linking referred to in Rule 6.13.3(2) may include:

PRUDENTIAL – INVESTMENT, INSURANCE INTERMEDIATION AND BANKING (PIB)

(a)

the User being made aware of the payment amount and the beneficiary;

(b)

the authentication code generated using SCA being specific to the transaction amount and the beneficiary; and

(c) any change to the amount or the beneficiary resulting in the authentication code becoming

invalid.

4. The security measures referred to in Rule 6.13.3(4) may include:

(a)

the use of separated secure execution environments through the software installed on the device;

(b) mechanisms to ensure that the software or device has not been, and cannot be, altered by the

User or a third party; and

(c) where alterations have taken place, mechanisms to mitigate the consequences.

Exceptions

6.13.4 An Authorised Firm is not required to apply strong customer authentication under

Rule 6.13.3 when:

(a)

the User accesses its own payment account information unless:

(i)

it is the first time the account is accessed; or

(ii) the account has not been accessed for 90 days or more;

(b)

the User makes a payment of a small amount;

(c)

the User makes a payment to a specified beneficiary on a list created by the User, or under a standing order, where strong customer authentication was applied when the list or standing order was created; or

(d)

a transfer is made between accounts held by the same User.

Guidance

In Rule 6.13.4(b) an example of a small amount may be a transaction not exceeding a certain value e.g. $50 or five payments not exceeding an aggregated amount of $150 over a specified period.

Technical standards

6.13.5 An Authorised Firm must develop and implement technical standards relating to:

(a)

the implementation of the requirements for strong customer authentication referred to in Rule 6.13.3;

(b) procedures for applying the exclusions in Rule 6.13.4;

(c) common and secure standards of communication for the purpose of identification, authentication, notification, and sharing information with Users and other service providers; and

(d)

if applicable, procedures, systems and controls that ensure the reliability and continuity of the interface made available by a Payment Account Provider.

1.

In developing technical standards referred to in 6.13.5(c) (common and secure standards of communication) an Authorised Firm should, as best practice and where applicable:

(a) apply secure identification when communicating between devices used for electronic

payments;

(b) address the risk of a communication being misdirected to unauthorised parties;

(c)

trace all payment transactions and interactions with all relevant parties to the Payment Service;

(d) use strong and widely recognised encryption techniques when exchanging data;

(e) keep the access sessions with the Payment Account Provider (PAP) as short as possible and

terminate any session after the requested action is completed;

(f) ensure, when maintaining parallel network sessions, that the sessions are securely linked to relevant sessions established with the User to prevent the possibility that information communicated between them could be misrouted;

(g)

include unambiguous unique references to the User, communication session, payment transaction and requested amount; and

(h) have systems and controls to prevent access to User information being available by the Payment Account Provider, beyond what is needed to provide the relevant service. The frequency of the access should also be agreed with the User.
