In appropriate cases, the DFSA may designate an Authorised Firm as both a G-SIB and a D-SIB if its failure could have a significant impact on both the global and regional financial systems. If the DFSA designates a firm as both a G-SIB and a D-SIB, the HLA Capital Buffer that applies will be whichever is the higher of the amount calculated for it as a G-SIB and the amount calculated for it as a D-SIB (see Rule 3.9B.3). If a firm is a G-SIB, it does not automatically mean that it will be a D-SIB. For example, a firm may be systemically important globally, but it may not conduct significant business locally or regionally.
