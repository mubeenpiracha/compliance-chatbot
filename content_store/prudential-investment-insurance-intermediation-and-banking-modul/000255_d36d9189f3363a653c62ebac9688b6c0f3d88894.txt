 for any other HQLA.

3.

The calculation of the stock of HQLA under Rule A9.2.5 can be expressed as the following formula:

Stock of HQLA = Level 1 HQLA + Level 2A HQLA + Level 2B HQLA – Adjustment for 15% cap – Adjustment for 40% cap

Where:

a.

Adjustment for 15% cap = Max (Adjusted Level 2B HQLA – 15/85 x(Adjusted Level 1 HQLA + Level 2A HQLA), Adjusted Level 2B HQLA - 15/60 x (Adjusted Level 1 HQLA, 0)

b.

Adjustment for 40% cap = Max ((Adjusted Level 2A HQLA + Adjusted Level 2B HQLA – Adjustment for 15% cap) - 2/3 x Adjusted Level 1 HQLA, 0)

Level 1 HQLA
