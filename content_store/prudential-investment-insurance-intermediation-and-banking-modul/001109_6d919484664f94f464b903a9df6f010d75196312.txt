Quantitative standards

7.

The DFSA will usually only approve an internal Value-at-Risk (VaR) model or its use when the VaR model meets the following quantitative criteria:

a.

VaR should be computed at least on a daily basis;

b.

in calculating the value-at-risk, a 99th percentile, one-tailed confidence interval is to be used;

c.

in calculating VaR, an instantaneous price shock equivalent to a 10 day movement in prices is to be used, i.e., the minimum "holding period" will be 10 trading days;
