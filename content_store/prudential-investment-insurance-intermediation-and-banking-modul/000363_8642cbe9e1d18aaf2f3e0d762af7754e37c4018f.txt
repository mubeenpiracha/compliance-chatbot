An Authorised Firm must risk-weight any specialised lending Exposure for which a directly applicable external credit assessment by a recognised external credit rating agency is not available as follows:

(a) where the purpose is to finance the acquisition of physical assets (such as ships, aircraft, satellites, railcars or fleets) and where the repayment of the Exposure is dependent on the cash flows generated by the specific assets that have been financed and pledged or assigned to the lender (“Object Finance”), by assigning a risk weight of 100%;

(b) where the purpose is to provide short-term financing of reserves, inventories or receivables of exchange-traded commodities (such as crude oil, metals or crops) and where the Exposure will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the commodity and the obligor has no independent capacity to repay the Exposure (“Commodities Finance”), by assigning a risk weight of 100%;
