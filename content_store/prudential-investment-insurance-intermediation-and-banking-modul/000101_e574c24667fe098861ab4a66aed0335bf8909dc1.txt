4.14.32 (1)

In respect of securitisation positions which are assigned a 1000% risk weighting pursuant to the tables in Rule 4.14.31, an Authorised Firm may as an alternative to including the position in its calculation of Credit RWA amounts, deduct from its CET1 Capital the Exposure value of such positions.

(2)

For the purposes of this Rule, the calculation of the Exposure value may reflect eligible funded credit protection consistent with applicable Rules in this chapter.

4.14.33 For an Authorised Firm that is an Originator or Sponsor of a securitisation, the Credit RWA amounts calculated for its securitisation positions may be limited to the RWA amounts which would be calculated for the SE Exposures had they not been Securitised subject to the presumed application of a 150% risk weight to all past due items and items belonging to regulatory high risk categories.

Exceptions to deduction of unrated securitisation Exposures

4.14.36 In accordance with the tables under Rule 4.14.31, all unrated securitisation positions must be deducted or risk weighted at 1000% with the following exceptions:

(a)

most senior Exposure in a securitisation;

(b)

Exposures that are in a second loss position or better of an ABCP and meet the requirements of Rule 4.14.41; and

(c)

eligible liquidity positions.

Most senior Exposure in a securitisation

4.14.37 (1)

Where an Authorised Firm holds or guarantees unrated securitisation Exposure from the most senior tranche in a securitisation, the Authorised Firm may apply the “look through” treatment, provided the composition of the underlying pool of Exposures securitised is known at all times and the Authorised Firm is able to determine the applicable risk weights for the underlying Exposures.

(2)

An Authorised Firm applying the look-through treatment to an unrated securitisation Exposure, pursuant to (1), must apply to that securitisation Exposure the weighted average of the risk weights of the underlying Exposures determined in accordance with the Rules in this chapter, multiplied by a concentration factor.

(3)

For the purposes of (2), the concentration factor is calculated as the sum of the nominal amounts of all the tranches in that securitisation divided by the sum of the nominal amounts of the tranches junior to, or pari-passu with, the tranche in which the position is held, including that tranche itself. The resulting weighted average risk weight must not be higher than 1000% or lower than the risk weight applicable to a more senior tranche which is rated.

(4)

Where the Authorised Firm is unable to determine the risk weights for the underlying Exposures the unrated securitisation position will not be eligible for the relief and must be deducted from CET 1 Capital of the Authorised Firm.

in accordance with

this Rule,

4.14.38 An Authorised Firm wishing to apply the treatment referred to in Rule 4.14.37 must notify the DFSA
