 types of Exposures in a Netting Set,

provided all premia have been paid upfront.

(5) An Authorised Firm may cap the Exposure value of a credit derivative at the

amount of unpaid premia if all the following conditions are met:

(a)

the Authorised Firm is the protection seller;

(b)

the credit derivative is not included in any netting or Margin Agreement.

(6) Where eligible Collateral is taken outside a Netting Set but is available to an Authorised Firm to offset default losses from transactions subject to this section, an Authorised Firm must calculate the Exposure value as follows:

(a)

if eligible Collateral is available to offset losses on one Netting Set only, an Authorised Firm must treat the eligible Collateral as an independent Collateral amount associated with that Netting Set; and

(b)

if eligible Collateral is available to offset losses on more than one Netting Set, the eligible Collateral must be treated as Collateral taken under a single Margin Agreement applying to multiple Netting Sets.

(7)

If eligible Collateral is available to offset losses on transactions subject to this section and on other transactions, an Authorised Firm must include only the portion of eligible Collateral assigned to the transactions subject to this section.

Replacement Cost (RC)

A4.8.3 (1) An Authorised Firm must calculate the replacement cost, RC, for an Unmargined

Netting Set using the following formula:

RC = max {V ‚àí CH(one year);O}

where:

V =

the current market value of all the transactions in the Netting Set

CH(one year) = the haircut value of net Collateral held, calculated in accordance

with (3), with a holding period of one year

(2) An Authorised Firm must calculate the replacement cost, RC, for a Margined

Netting Set using the following formula:

RC = max {V ‚àí Cùêª(MPoR);TH + MTA ‚àí NICA;O}

where:

V =

the total current market value of all the transactions in the Netting Set

CH(MPoR) =

the haircut value of net Collateral held, calculated in accordance with (3), with a holding period of MPoR

TH =

the positive threshold before the Counterparty must send the Authorised Firm collateral

MTA =

the minimum transfer amount applicable to the Counterparty

NICA =

the net independent Collateral amount

(3) For the purpose of (1) and (2), an Authorised Firm must calculate the haircut value

of net Collateral, CH, using the following formula:

CH(t) = {

C ‚àô (1 ‚àí H(t)),if C ‚â• 0 C ‚àô (1 + H(t)),if C < 0

where:

C =

the current mark-to-market value of the net Collateral held, excluding Collateral posted by the Authorised Firm in a bankruptcy remote manner

t =

the holding period applicable to the Collateral

H(t) =

the haircut appropriate to the Collateral using a holding period of ‚Äòt‚Äô, determined in accordance with Rule A4.3.5

(4)

If a single Margin Agreement applies to multiple Netting Sets, an Authorised Firm must calculate RC using the following formula:

RC = max{ ‚àë ùëöùëéùë•{ùëâùëÅùëÜ;0} ‚àí max{ùê∂ùëÄùê¥;0};0

} + ùëöùëéùë• { ‚àë ùëöùëñùëõ{ùëâùëÅùëÜ;0} ‚àí min{ùê∂ùëÄùê¥;0};0

}

ùëÅùëÜ‚ààùëÄùê¥

ùëÅùëÜ‚ààùëÄùê¥

where:

NS =

the index that denotes the Netting Sets that are subject to the single Margin Agreement

VNS =

the current net mark-to-market value of all the transactions within the Netting Set
