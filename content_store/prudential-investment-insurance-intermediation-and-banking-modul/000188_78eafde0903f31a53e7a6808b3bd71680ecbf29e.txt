 (which SA-CCR does not specifically assign to a particular asset class) in the same manner as they treat interest rate derivatives and subject them to the same 0.5% supervisory factor. Derivatives referencing inflation rates for the same currency should form a separate hedging set.

Add-on for transactions in the foreign exchange asset class

A4.8.8 (1) An Authorised Firm must calculate the add-on for each hedging set of the foreign

exchange asset class,AddOnj

FX, using the following formula:

AddOnj

FX = SFFX ∙ EffNotj

FX

where:

SFIR =

the supervisory factor for the interest rate asset class, determined in accordance with Rule A4.8.18

EffNotj

IR = the effective notional amount of hedging set ‘j’, calculated in

accordance with (2)

j =

the index that denotes all hedging sets of the foreign exchange asset class, formed in accordance with Rule A4.8.5

(2) For the purpose of (1), an Authorised Firm must calculate the effective notional

amount’ of hedging set ‘j’, EffNotj

FX, using the following formula:

𝐄𝐟𝐟𝐍𝐨𝐭𝐣

𝐅𝐗 = ∑ 𝛅𝐢 ∙ 𝐀𝐝𝐣𝐍𝐨𝐭𝐢

𝐅𝐗 ∙ 𝐌𝐅𝐢

𝐢∈𝐈(𝐣)

where:

I(j) =

the set of all interest rate transactions belonging to hedging set ‘j’

δi =

the supervisory delta for the transaction ‘i’, calculated in accordance with Rule A4.8.12

MFi =

the maturity factor of the transaction ‘i’, calculated in accordance with Rule A4.8.15

AdjNoti

FX = the adjusted notional amount accordance with Rule A4.8.13(b)

for

transaction

‘i’, calculated

in

j =

the index that denotes all the hedging sets of the foreign exchange asset class, formed in accordance with Rule A4.8.5

Guidance

The steps to calculate the add-on for the foreign exchange asset class are similar to the steps for the interest rate asset class, except that there is no allocation of trades to maturity buckets (which means that there is full offsetting of long and short positions within the hedging sets of the foreign exchange derivative asset class).

Add-on for transactions in the credit asset class

A4.8.9 (1) An Authorised Firm must divide the transactions of each hedging set of the credit asset class into different categories with each category containing all the transactions referencing the same entity or index.

(2) An Authorised Firm must calculate the add-on for hedging set ‘j’ of the credit asset

class, AddOnj

CR, using the following formula:

AddOnj

CR = √(∑ρk CR

𝐴𝑑𝑑𝑂𝑛𝑘

+∑(1 − (ρk
