A4.9 Exposures to Central Counterparties (CCPs)

A4.9.1 An Authorised Firm may determine the Exposure value of a Credit Risk Exposure outstanding with a CCP in accordance with A4.9.2, provided that the CCP’s Counterparty Credit Risk Exposure with all participants in its arrangements are fully collateralised on a daily basis and the CCP is a qualifying CCP.

A4.9.2 An Authorised Firm may attribute an Exposure value of zero, for purposes of calculating the CRCOM to Derivative contracts and deferred settlement transactions, or to other Exposures arising in respect of those contracts or transactions (excluding an Exposure arising from Collateral held with CCPs as part of its default fund) where such Exposures are outstanding with a CCP and have not been rejected by the CCP.

A4.9.3 An Authorised Firm which purchases Credit Derivative protection against a Non-Trading Book Exposure or against a Counterparty Credit Risk Exposure, must compute Market Risk Capital Requirements for the hedged asset in accordance with the relevant Rules in chapter 5.

The Protection Buyer relies on the Protection Seller to pay the Credit Event Payment if a Credit Event occurs, and therefore must compute Credit RWAs for the Counterparty Risk involved.

The Protection Seller is exposed to the Protection Buyer only if there are premium or interest rate-related payments outstanding.

A4.9.6

In the case of Total Return Swaps, since each party relies on the other for payment, each party must compute Credit RWAs.

A4.9.7 No Credit RWA applies to credit-linked notes unless a coupon or interest payment is

outstanding.

A4.9.8

(1) An Authorised Firm shall determine the Exposure value for clearing Exposures to non-qualifying CCPs as the amount in the table below:
