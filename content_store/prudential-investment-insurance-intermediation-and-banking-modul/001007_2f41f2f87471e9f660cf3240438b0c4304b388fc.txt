2.

The “Other” category will receive the same Specific Risk requirement as a private-sector borrower under the CRCOM, 8%. However, since this may, in certain cases, considerably underestimate the Specific Risk for debt Securities which have a high yield to redemption relative to government debt Securities, the DFSA has the right to apply to such Securities a Specific Risk percentage higher than 8%.
