 the purpose of (6)(b)(iii), revenues are availability-based if:

(a)

the entity is entitled to payments from its contractual counterparties once construction is completed, as long as contractual conditions are fulfilled;

(b)

the payments are sized to cover operating and maintaining costs, debt service costs and equity returns as the entity operates the project; and

(c)

the revenues are not subject to swings in demand, such as traffic levels, and are adjusted typically only for lack of performance or lack of availability of the assets to the public.

Retail Exposures

4.12.16 (1) An Authorised Firm must, subject to Rule 4.12.17, risk-weight Retail Exposures

as follows:

(a) Regulatory Retail Exposures that do not arise from Exposures to

Transactors must be assigned a risk weight of 75%;

(b) Regulatory Retail Exposures that arise from Exposures to Transactors

must be assigned a risk weight of 45%; and

(c)

other Retail Exposures that do not qualify as Regulatory Retail Exposures must be assigned a risk weight of 100%.

(2) For the purposes of (1), a Retail Exposure qualifies as a Regulatory Retail

Exposure if it meets all of the following conditions:

(a)

the Retail Exposure takes the form of any of the following types of Exposure:

(i)

revolving credit and lines of credit, including credit cards, charge cards and overdrafts;

(ii)

personal term loans and leases, including instalment loans, vehicle loans and leases, student and educational loans and personal finance; or

(iii) small business credit facilities and commitments;

but excluding mortgage loans, derivatives and other securities (such as bonds or equities), whether listed or not;

(b)

the gross value of the Retail Exposure (either individually or aggregated with all other Retail Exposures) to a single obligor or a group of Closely Related Counterparties does not exceed $1 million; and

(c)

the gross value of the Retail Exposure (either individually or aggregated with all other Retail Exposures) to a single obligor or a group of Closely Related Counterparties does not exceed 0.2% of the overall Retail Exposures.

Guidance

1.

In deciding on whether an Exposure, including one arising from Islamic Financial Business arrangements, falls within the types of Exposures referred to in Rule 4.12.16(2)(a), an Authorised Firm should take a “substance over form” approach.

2. When calculating the ‘gross value of the Retail Exposure’ in Rule 4.12.16(2)(b) and (c) an Authorised Firm should not take into account any credit risk mitigation. In case of off balance sheet items, the amount should be calculated after applying credit conversion factors.

3.

To apply the 0.2% threshold under Rule 4.12.16(2)(c), an Authorised Firm should, first, identify the full set of Retail Exposures and, second, identify the subset of Exposures that meet the criterion in Rule 4.12.16(2)(a) and do not exceed the threshold in Rule 4.12.16(2)(b) and, third, exclude any Exposures that have a value greater than 0.2% of the subset before exclusion.

4.12.17 (1) An Authorised Firm must apply a 1.5 times multiplier to the applicable risk weight calculated under Rule 4.12.16(1) to any unhedged Retail Exposure to an individual where the lending currency differs from the currency of the obligor’s source of income, subject to a maximum risk weight of 150%.

(2) For the purposes of (1), a Retail Exposure is hedged if:

(a)

the obligor:

(i)

in its normal operating procedures, receives foreign currency income that matches the currency of a given Exposure, such as remittances, rental incomes or salaries; or

(ii)
