 the requirements under this section by ensuring coverage of its activities under a group-wide PII policy, provided that policy covers the Authorised Firm and its activities and that policy meets the conditions specified in this section. Where the Authorised Firm’s group PII cover does not meet the requirements specified under this section, the Authorised Firm will be required to obtain PII cover that meets those requirements.

6.13 Management of Operational Risk in Money Services

6.13.1 This section applies to an Authorised Firm that provides:

(a) Money Services;

(b) Account Information Services; or

(c) Payment Initiation Services.

Definition of strong customer authentication

6.13.2

(1)

In this section, “strong customer authentication” or “SCA” means authentication that is based on the use of two or more elements that are:

(a)

independent, in that breach of one element does not compromise the reliability of any other element; and

(b) designed in such a way as to protect the confidentiality of the

authentication data.

(2) The elements in (1)(a) must consist of two or more of the following:

(a)

something known only by the User (“knowledge”);

(b)

something held only by the User (“possession”); or

(c)

something inherent to the User (“inherence”).

Strong customer authentication and User security measures

6.13.3

(1) An Authorised Firm must, except as provided in Rule 6.13.4, apply strong

customer authentication where a User:

PIB/VER50/07-25

PRUDENTIAL – INVESTMENT, INSURANCE INTERMEDIATION AND BANKING (PIB)

(a) accesses a Payment Account online, either directly or through an Account

Information Service;

(b) initiates an electronic Payment Transaction; or

(c) carries out any action through a remote channel which may imply a risk of

payment fraud or other abuses.

(2) If a payer initiates a Payment Transaction directly or through a Payment Initiation Service, the Authorised Firm must apply SCA that includes elements which dynamically link the transaction to a specific amount and a specific payee.

(3) If a multipurpose device is used in the SCA process, the Authorised Firm must adopt adequate security measures that mitigate the risk of the device being compromised.

(4) The Authorised Firm must maintain adequate security measures to protect the

confidentiality and integrity of Users’ personal security credentials.

Guidance

1. An Authorised Firm should, as best practice in maintaining the integrity of strong customer authentication, try to ensure that:

(a) no element of ‘knowledge’, ‘possession’ or ‘inherence’ (as defined in Rule 6.13.2) can be

derived from the disclosure of the authentication code cover;

(b)

it is not possible to generate a new authentication code based on an old one;

(c)

the authentication code cannot be forged;

(d) where the authentication through a remote channel has failed to generate an authentication

code, it is not possible to identify which of the SCA elements was incorrect;

(e) a maximum of 5 failed consecutive authentication attempts within a given period result in

the account being temporarily or permanently blocked;

(f)

the duration and number of retries for a temporary block should be linked to the service offered and trigger a fraud risk alert; and

(g)

the User is alerted before the block becomes permanent and a secure procedure is established to regain the use of the blocked payment instrument.

2. An Authorised Firm should, as best practice in maintaining the integrity of User security credentials (USC), endeavour:

(a) not to allow the USC to be fully readable when inputted by the User or by its own staff;

(b)

to ensure that the USC always remain encrypted and no information relating to the USC is stored in plain text;

(c)

to protect secret cryptographic material from unauthorised disclosure;

(d)

to document the process used to encrypt or otherwise render the USCs unreadable;

(e)

to adopt measures to mitigate the risk of unauthorised use of compromised USCs;

(f)

to ensure secure delivery of the USC to the User, secure association of the USC with the User and the secure disposal of the USC once it is obsolete; and

(g)

to immediately inform the User and the issuer of the USC (if another firm) in the event a USC
