Guidance

1.

The Governing Body of the Authorised Firm may delegate responsibility for establishing Non- Trading Book interest rate risk policies and strategies to the Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) or an equivalent committee, which is the designated senior management committee for managing balance sheet structure and interest rate risk associated with it.

2.

An Authorised Firm involved in banking activities or complex principal dealing activities should have a designated committee for design and implementation of Non-Trading Book interest rate risk management.

3.

An Authorised Firm should establish and enforce operating limits and other practices that maintain Exposures within levels consistent with their internal policies and that accord with their approach to measuring the risk. In particular, Authorised Firms should set a limit on the extent to which floating rate Exposures are funded by fixed rate sources and vice versa to limit the risk. In floating rate lending, Authorised Firms should limit the extent to which they run any basis risk that may arise if lending and funding are not based on precisely the same market interest rate.
