A5.2.22 The General Market Risk requirement for each currency must be calculated as the sum

of the following:

(a)

5% of the matched weighted positions in each time band;

(b)

40% of the matched weighted position in zone A;

(c)

30% of the matched weighted position in zones B and C;

(d)

40% of the matched weighted position between zones A and B, and between zones B and C;

(e)

100% of the matched weighted position between zones A and C; and

(f)

100% of the residual unmatched weighted positions.
