13. Where the DFSA does not agree with the results of the firm’s ICAAP results, the DFSA will involve the firm in a dialogue to reconcile any difference in view to arrive at a consensus estimate of the capital level required to address all risks identified either by the firm or by the DFSA in its SREP. Such an estimate will be specified by the DFSA as the Individual Capital Requirement for the firm. Where consensus is not possible the DFSA may impose an Individual Capital Requirement on a firm.
