(d) other than in the event of non-payment by the Authorised Firm of money due in respect of the guarantee if applicable, there is an irrevocable obligation on the part of the guarantor to pay out a pre- determined amount upon the occurrence of a credit event, as defined under the guarantee;

(e)

the guarantee does not contain any clause, the fulfilment of which is outside the direct control of the Authorised Firm, that:

(i) would allow the guarantor to cancel the guarantee unilaterally;

(ii) would increase the effective cost of the guarantee as a result of

deteriorating credit quality of the underlying Exposure;

(iii) could prevent the guarantor from being obliged to pay out in a timely manner in the event that the underlying obligor fails to make any payment due; or

(iv) could allow the maturity of the guarantee agreed ex-ante to be

reduced ex-post by the guarantor;

(f)

the Authorised Firm is able in a timely manner to pursue the guarantor for any monies outstanding under the documentation governing the transaction on the default of, or non-payment by, the underlying obligor without first having to take legal action to pursue the underlying obligor for payment; and
