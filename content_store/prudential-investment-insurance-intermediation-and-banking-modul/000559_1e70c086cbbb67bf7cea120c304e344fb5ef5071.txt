Guidance

1.

An Authorised Firm should record all Operational Risk events, including near misses and events which result in a positive financial outcome.

These Rules complement related Rules in section 5.3 of the GEN module relating to risk management systems and controls. For example, GEN Rule 5.3.6 requires an Authorised Firm to appoint an individual to advise its Governing Body and senior management as to risks.

An Authorised Firm must ensure that its Operational Risk policy in Rule 6.2.1:

(a)

includes an approval process for all new products, activities, processes and systems; and

(b)

incorporates the requirement in Rule 6.3.1(a).
