7. Where an Authorised Firm obtains credit protection that differs in maturity from the underlying credit Exposure, the Authorised Firm should monitor and control its roll-off risks, i.e. the fact that the Authorised Firm will be fully exposed when the protection expires, and the risk that it will be unable to purchase credit protection or ensure its capital adequacy when the credit protection expires. Taking as Collateral large quantities of instruments issued by one obligor creates Concentration Risk. An Authorised Firm should have a clearly defined policy with respect to the amount of Concentration Risk it is prepared to run. Such a policy might, for example, include a cap on the amount of Collateral it would be prepared to take from a particular Issuer or market. The Authorised Firm should also take Collateral and purchased credit protection into account when assessing the potential concentrations in its overall credit profile.
