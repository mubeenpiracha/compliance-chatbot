In the formula in Rule A4.8.3(2), TH + MTA â€“ NICA represents the largest exposure that would not trigger a Variation Margin call and it contains levels of Collateral that need always to be maintained. For example, without initial margin, the greatest exposure that would not trigger a Variation Margin call is the threshold plus any minimum transfer amount. In the adapted formulation, NICA is subtracted from TH + MTA. This makes the calculation more accurate by fully reflecting both the actual level of exposure that would not trigger a margin call and the effect of Collateral held and /or posted by a bank. The calculation is floored at zero, recognising that the Authorised Firm may hold NICA in excess of TH + MTA, which could otherwise result in a negative replacement cost.
