(g)

any Exposure classified as a position or instrument in the Trading Book in accordance with section A2.1.

To calculate its RWA for CR Exposures, an Authorised Firm must:

(a)

calculate the value of the Exposure (represented as “E”) for every on- balance sheet and every off-balance sheet asset in accordance with the Exposure measurement methodology specified in section 4.9 and recognising the effects of any applicable Credit Risk mitigation;

(b)

categorise that Exposure in accordance with the Rules in section 4.10;

(c)

allocate an applicable Credit Quality Grade and risk weight for that Exposure in accordance with the Rules in section 4.11 and 4.12;

(d)

calculate the RWA amount for that Exposure using the following formula:

RWA(CR) = E x CRW

where:

(i)

“RWA(CR)” refers to the risk-weighted Exposure amount for that CR Exposure;

(ii)

“E” refers to the Exposure value or amount, for that CR Exposure; and

(iii)

“CRW” refers to the applicable risk weight for that CR Exposure determined in accordance with (b) and (c); and

(e)

add the RWA amounts calculated in accordance with (d) for all its CR Exposures.

Calculation of RWA for securitisation Exposures (SE Exposures)

To calculate its RWA for all its SE Exposures, an Authorised Firm must:

(a)

calculate the value of the Exposure for each of its SE Exposures in accordance with Exposure measurement methodology specified in section 4.9 and recognising the effects of any applicable Credit Risk mitigation;

(b)

allocate an applicable Credit Quality Grade for that SE Exposure in accordance with the Rules in section 4.11;

(c)

calculate the RWA amount for each SE Exposure, except for those SE Exposures which the Authorised Firm is required to include as deductions from any component of Capital Resources, using the following formula:

RWA(SE) = SE x CRW

where:

(i)

“RWA(SE)” refers to the risk-weighted Exposure amount for that securitisation Exposure;

(ii)

“SE” refers to the Exposure value or amount for that SE Exposure calculated in accordance with (a); and

(iii)

“CRW” refers to the applicable risk weight for that SE Exposure determined in accordance with (b); and

(d)

add the RWA amounts calculated in accordance with (c) for all its SE Exposures to the RWA amounts calculated in accordance with Rule 4.8.5 in respect of its Early Amortisation Exposures.

To calculate its RWA for Early Amortisation Exposures, an Authorised Firm must:

(a)

calculate the value of the Exposure (EAE) for each of its Early Amortisation Exposures in accordance with Exposure measurement methodology specified in section 4.9 and recognising the effects of any applicable Credit Risk mitigation;

(b)

calculate the risk-weighted Exposure amount for each Early Amortisation Exposure using the following formula:

RWA(EAE) = EAE x CRW

where:

(i)

“RWA(EAE)” refers to the risk-weighted Exposure amount for that Early Amortisation Exposure;

(ii)

“EAE” refers to the Exposure value or amount, for that Early Amortisation Exposure calculated in accordance with (a); and

(iii)

“CRW” refers to the applicable risk weight for the underlying Exposure type as if the Exposure had not been securitised; and

(c)

add the RWA amounts calculated in accordance with (b) for all its Early Amortisation Exposures.

The aggregate RWA amount for all of the SE Exposures of an Authorised Firm to a securitisation and Exposures arising from Credit Risk mitigation applied to those SE Exposures must not exceed the aggregate RWA amount corresponding to the underlying Expos
