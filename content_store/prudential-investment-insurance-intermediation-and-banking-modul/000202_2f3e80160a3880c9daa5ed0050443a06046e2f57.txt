Group of Closely Related Counterparties

A4.11.5 (1)

For Concentration Risk purposes, Persons are Closely Related if:

(a)

the insolvency or default of one of them is likely to be associated with the insolvency or default of the others;

(b)

it would be prudent when assessing creditworthiness of one to consider that of the others;

the

financial condition or

(c)

PRUDENTIAL – INVESTMENT, INSURANCE INTERMEDIATION AND BANKING (PIB)

(2)

Persons are to be assessed as being economically interdependent for the purposes of (1)(d) where one or more of the following factors are present:

(a) 50% or more of the annual receipts or expenditures of one is derived from

transactions with the other;

(b) a guarantee issued by one in favour of the other party is likely to result in

the provider default if called;

(c)

significant output is sold to the other party and an alternative buyer is not easily found;

(d)

single source of funds to repay loans for both parties with no alternative; or

(e)

common reliance on the same funding provider that is hard to replace.

(3)

An Authorised Firm need not assess economic interdependence under (2) for a transaction where the sum of all Exposures to one individual counterparty is less than 5% of the Authorised Firm’s T1 Capital.

(4)

Persons who are Closely Related to each other are also Connected with each other.

(5)

The requirement to aggregate Exposures where Persons are Closely Related does not apply where an Authorised Firm can demonstrate to the DFSA that it is unlikely that Persons who are Closely Related will default at the same time and the DFSA has, by notice in writing, disapplied the requirement.

A4.11.6 (1)

A single group of Closely Related Counterparties means, in relation to an Authorised Firm, all the Persons to which the Authorised Firm has an Exposure and which are Closely Related to each other.

(2)

An Authorised Firm must treat two or more Persons as falling within a group of Closely Related Counterparties if the Authorised Firm has Exposures to them all and any loss to the Authorised Firm on any of the Exposures to one is likely to be associated with a loss to the Authorised Firm with respect to at least one Exposure to each of the others.

Guidance:

Two or more Counterparties between whom there is no relationship of control as described in Rules A4.11.5 and A4.11.6 will be regarded as constituting a single risk if they are so interconnected that, if one of them were to experience financial problems, in particular funding or repayment difficulties, the other or all of the others would also be likely to encounter funding or repayment difficulties.

Connected Counterparties

A4.11.7 (1)

For Concentration Risk purposes, and in relation to a Person, a Connected Counterparty means another Person to whom the first Person has an Exposure and who fulfils one of the following conditions:
