In accordance with the Basel Committee framework, this section provides for the DFSA to designate two types of SIBs: global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) and domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs). The main difference between the two types of SIBs, is that G-SIBs are capable of having a significant impact on the effective working and stability of the global financial system, while the potential impact of D-SIBs is on the local or regional financial system. The differences in the requirements that apply to each are explained later in this section.
