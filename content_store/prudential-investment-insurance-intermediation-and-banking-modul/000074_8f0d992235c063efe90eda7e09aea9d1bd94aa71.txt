4.12.10 (1) An Authorised Firm must classify Exposures to banks for which an external credit assessment by a recognised external credit rating agency is not available as Grade A, Grade B or Grade C in accordance with the following principles:

(a) where the bank has adequate capacity to meet its financial commitments in a timely manner for the projected life of the assets or exposures and irrespective of the economic cycles and business conditions, it may be classified Grade A. A counterparty bank classified into Grade A must meet or exceed the published minimum regulatory requirements and buffers (excluding liquidity standards) established by its national supervisor as implemented in the jurisdiction where it is incorporated or established, except for bank-specific minimum financial regulatory requirements or buffers that may be imposed through supervisory actions and not made public. If such minimum financial regulatory requirements (other than bank-specific minimum regulatory requirements or buffers) are not publicly disclosed or otherwise made available by the counterparty bank, then the counterparty bank must be classified as Grade B or lower;

(b) where the counterparty bank is subject to substantial credit risk, such as repayment capacities that are dependent on stable or favourable economic or business conditions, it may not be classified higher than Grade B. A counterparty bank classified as Grade B must meet or exceed the published minimum regulatory capital requirements (excluding buffers and liquidity standards) established by its national supervisor as implemented in the jurisdiction where it is incorporated or established, except for bank-specific minimum financial regulatory requirements that may be imposed through supervisory actions and are not made public. If such minimum regulatory requirements are not publicly disclosed or otherwise made available by the counterparty bank then the counterparty bank must be classified as Grade C;

(c) where the counterparty bank has material default risks and limited margins of safety, it must be classified Grade C. For this purpose a counterparty bank has material default risk and limited margins of safety where adverse business, financial or economic conditions are very likely

(ii) where the audited financial statements are required, the external auditor has issued an adverse audit opinion or has expressed substantial doubt about the counterparty bank’s ability to continue as going concern in its financial statements or audited reports within the previous 12 months.
