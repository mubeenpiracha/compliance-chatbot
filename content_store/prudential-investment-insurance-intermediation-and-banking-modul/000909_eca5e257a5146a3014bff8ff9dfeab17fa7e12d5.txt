Guidance

The calculation of the add-on for the commodity asset class is similar to the calculation of the add-on for the credit and equity asset classes. It recognises the full offsetting of long and short positions for derivatives that reference the same type of underlying commodity. It also allows partial offsetting between derivatives that reference different types of commodities, however, this partial offsetting is only permitted within each of the four hedging sets of the commodity asset class, where the different commodity types are more likely to demonstrate some stable, meaningful joint dynamics. Offsetting between hedging sets is not recognised (eg a forward contract on crude oil cannot hedge a forward contract on corn).
