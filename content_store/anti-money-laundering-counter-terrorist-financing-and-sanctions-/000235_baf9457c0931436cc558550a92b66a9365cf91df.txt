The DFSA considers that “an accounting firm, audit firm or insolvency firm” in paragraph (1)(e) of the DNFBP definition, includes forensic accounting services that use accounting skills, principles and techniques to investigate suspected illegal activity or to analyse financial information for use in legal proceedings.
