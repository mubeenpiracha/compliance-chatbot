Guidance on Shell Banks

8.

Rule 6.1.5 prohibits a Relevant Person from establishing or maintaining a business relationship with a Shell Bank. A Shell Bank is a bank that has no physical presence in the country in which it is incorporated or licensed, and is not affiliated with a regulated financial Group that is subject to effective consolidated supervision. The DFSA does not consider that the existence of a local agent or low level staff constitutes physical presence.

A Relevant Person should note that, in addition to the prohibition in Rule 6.1.6 against establishing anonymous or fictitious accounts or accounts for unknown persons, the Federal AML legislation also prohibits the creation or keeping of records of bank accounts using pseudonyms, fictitious names or numbered accounts, without the account holderâ€™s name.
