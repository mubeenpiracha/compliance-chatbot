Guidance

1.

In complying with Rule 7.7.1(1) a Relevant Person should apply one or more of the measures in (a) to (f) as appropriate in the circumstances. Where CDD cannot be completed, it may be appropriate not to carry out a transaction pending completion of CDD. Where CDD cannot be conducted, including where a material part of the CDD, such as identifying and verifying a Beneficial Owner cannot be conducted, a Relevant Person should not establish a business relationship with the customer.

2.

A Relevant Person should note that Rule 7.7.1 applies to both existing and prospective customers. For new customers it may be appropriate for a Relevant Person to terminate the business relationship before a product or service is provided. However, for existing customers, while termination of the business relationship should not be ruled out, suspension may be more appropriate depending on the circumstances. Whichever route is taken, the Relevant Person should be careful not to tip off the customer.
