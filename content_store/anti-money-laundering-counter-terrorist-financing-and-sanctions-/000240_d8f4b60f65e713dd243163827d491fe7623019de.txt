Anti-Money Laundering, Counter-Terrorist Financing and Sanctions Module (AML)

Guidance

1.

A DNFBP may request the withdrawal of its registration because, for example, it no longer meets the definition of a DNFBP, becomes insolvent or enters into administration, or proposes to leave the DIFC.

2.

In addition to being able to withdraw registration at a DNFBPâ€™s request, the DFSA may suspend or withdraw the registration of a DNFBP on its own initiative in various circumstances (see Article 71F of the Regulatory Law).
