13.5 Freezing assets

Guidance

The DFSA has power under the Regulatory Law to restrict an Authorised Person from disposing of or transferring property including, for example, assets or other funds suspected of relating to money laundering. It may also apply to the Court for an order restraining a person from transferring or disposing of any assets suspected of relating to money laundering. In cases involving suspected money laundering, the DFSA will usually take such action in co-ordination with the FIU.
