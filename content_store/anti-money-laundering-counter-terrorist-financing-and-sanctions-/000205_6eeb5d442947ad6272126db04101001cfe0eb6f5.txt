Anti-Money Laundering, Counter-Terrorist Financing and Sanctions Module (AML)

2.

Relevant Persons should take a risk-based approach to AML training. The DFSA considers that AML training should be provided by a Relevant Person to each of its relevant Employees at intervals appropriate to the role and responsibilities of the Employee. In the case of an Authorised Firm the DFSA expects that training should be provided to each relevant Employee at least annually.

3.

The manner in which AML training is provided by a Relevant Person need not be in a formal classroom setting, rather it may be via an online course or any other similarly appropriate manner.

4.

A relevant Employee would include a member of the senior management or operational staff, any Employee with customer contact or which handles or may handle customer monies or assets, and any other Employee who might otherwise encounter money laundering in the business.
