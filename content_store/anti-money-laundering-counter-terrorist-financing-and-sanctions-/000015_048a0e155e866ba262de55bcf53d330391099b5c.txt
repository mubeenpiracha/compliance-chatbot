The DIFC regime: Under Article 70(3) of the DIFC Regulatory Law 2004 (the “Regulatory Law”), the DFSA has jurisdiction for the regulation of anti-money laundering in the DIFC relating to Relevant Persons (see para 4 below) and their officers, employees and agents.

Note that under Article 71(1) of the Regulatory Law, the DIFC regime requires compliance with the Federal regime. It follows that a failure to comply with a provision of Federal Law No. 20 of 2018 on Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism and Illegal Organisations or Federal Law No. 7 of 2014 on Combating Terrorism Offences or the implementing regulations under those laws may also provide evidence of failure to comply with Article 71(1), which may then be addressed under the disciplinary and remedial provisions of the Regulatory Law and DFSA Rules.
