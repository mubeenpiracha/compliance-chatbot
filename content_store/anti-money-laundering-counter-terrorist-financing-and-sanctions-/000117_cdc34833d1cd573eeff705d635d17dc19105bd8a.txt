result in a criminal “gaming” the system by always keeping his financial interest below the relevant threshold. The DFSA considers that in some circumstances no threshold should be used when identifying Beneficial Owners because it may be important to identify all underlying Beneficial Owners in order to ensure that they are not associated or connected in some way. This may be appropriate where there are a small number of investors in an account or fund, each with a significant financial holding and the customer-specific risks are higher. However, where the customer- specific risks are lower, a threshold can be appropriate. For example, for a low-risk corporate customer which, combined with a lower-risk product or service, a percentage threshold may be appropriate for identifying “control” of the legal person for the purposes of the definition of a Beneficial Owner.
