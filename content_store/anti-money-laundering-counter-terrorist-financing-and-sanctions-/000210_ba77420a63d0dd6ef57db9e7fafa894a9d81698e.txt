The requirement for Employees to notify the Relevant Personâ€™s MLRO should include situations when no business relationship was developed because the circumstances were suspicious.

A Relevant Person may allow its Employees to consult with their line managers before sending a report to the MLRO. The DFSA would expect that such consultation does not prevent making a report whenever an Employee has stated that he has knowledge, suspicion or reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting that a person may be involved in money laundering. Whether or not an Employee consults with his line manager or other Employees, the responsibility remains with the Employee to decide for himself whether a notification to the MLRO should be made.

An Employee, including the MLRO, who considers that a person is engaged in or engaging in activity that he knows or suspects to be suspicious would not be expected to know the exact nature of the criminal offence or that the particular funds were definitely those arising from the crime of money laundering or terrorist financing.
