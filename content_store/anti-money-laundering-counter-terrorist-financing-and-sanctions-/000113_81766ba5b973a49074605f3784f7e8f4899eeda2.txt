Under Rule 7.3.1(3), a Relevant Person is required to verify the identity of a person based on reliable and independent source documents, data or information. A Relevant Person should generally have sight of original identification documents and retain a copy of the identification document. However in complying with Rule 7.3.1, it may not always be possible to obtain original documents. Where identification documents cannot be obtained in original form, for example, because a Relevant Person has no physical contact with the customer, the Relevant Person should obtain a copy certified as a true copy by a person of good standing such as a registered lawyer or notary, a chartered accountant, a bank manager, a police officer, an Employee of the person’s embassy or consulate, or other similar person. The DFSA considers that downloading publicly-available information from an official source (such as a regulator’s or other official government website) is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Rule 7.3.1. The DFSA also considers that CDD information and research obtained from a reputable company or information-reporting agency may also be acceptable as a reliable and independent source
