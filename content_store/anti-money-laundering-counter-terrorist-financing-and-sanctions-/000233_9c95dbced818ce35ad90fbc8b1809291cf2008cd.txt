Guidance

1.

A DNFBP should ensure that it complies with and has regard to relevant provisions of the Regulatory Law. The Regulatory Law gives the DFSA a power to supervise DNFBPs’ compliance with relevant AML laws in the State. The Regulatory Law requires a DNFBP to be registered by the DFSA to conduct its activities in the DIFC. Rule 15.1.2 sets out the criteria a DNFBP must meet to be registered. The Regulatory Law also gives the DFSA a number of other important powers in relation to DNFBPs, including powers of enforcement. This includes a power to obtain information and to conduct investigations into possible breaches of the Regulatory Law. The DFSA may impose fines for breaches of the Regulatory Law or the Rules. It may also suspend or withdraw the registration of a DNFBP in various circumstances.

2.

The DFSA takes a risk-based approach to regulation of persons which it supervises. Generally, the DFSA will work with DNFBPs to identify, assess, mitigate and control relevant risks where appropriate. RPP describes the DFSA’s enforcement powers under the Regulatory Law and outlines its policy for using these powers.
