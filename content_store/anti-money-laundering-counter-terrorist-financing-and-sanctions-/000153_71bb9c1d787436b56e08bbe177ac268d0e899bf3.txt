Where a particular jurisdictionâ€™s laws (such as secrecy or data protection legislation) would prevent a Relevant Person from having access to CDD information upon request without delay as referred to in Rule 8.1.1(3)(b), the Relevant Person should undertake the relevant CDD itself and should not seek to rely on the relevant third party. If a Relevant Person relies on a third party located in a foreign jurisdiction to conduct one or more elements of CDD on its behalf, the Relevant Person must ensure that the foreign jurisdiction has AML regulations that are equivalent to the standards in the FATF Recommendations (see Rule 8.1.1(3)(c) and Rule 8.1.2).
