Guidance

1.

In Rule 7.4.1 Enhanced CDD measures are only mandatory to the extent that they are applicable to the relevant customer or the circumstances of the business relationship and to the extent that the risks would reasonably require it. Therefore, the extent of additional measures to conduct is a matter for the Relevant Person to determine on a case by case basis.

2.

In Rule 7.4.1 (e), senior management approval may be given by an individual member of the Relevant Person’s senior management. A Relevant Person may also establish a committee to consider high risk customers. However, in that case, the approval would, nonetheless, have to be given by a member of the senior management, who can be a member of the committee.

3.

For high risk customers, a Relevant Person should, in order to mitigate the perceived and actual risks, exercise a greater degree of diligence throughout the customer relationship and should endeavour to understand the nature of the customer’s business and consider whether it is consistent and reasonable.
