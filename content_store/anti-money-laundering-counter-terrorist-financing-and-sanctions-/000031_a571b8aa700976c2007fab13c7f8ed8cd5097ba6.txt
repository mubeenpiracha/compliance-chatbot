Dealers in precious metals or precious stones

33.

The Regulatory Law requires a person who carries on a Designated Non-Financial Business or Profession (DNFBP) in or from the DIFC to be registered by the DFSA. In the case of a dealer in precious metals or precious stones, the DNFBP definition applies to a dealer which carries out a single cash transaction, or several cash transactions that appear to be connected, with a value of $15,000 or more. Therefore, a dealer in precious metals or precious stones will not have to register as a DNFBP if it can ensure that the value of each transaction it carries out (single or connected) is under that threshold.
