Chapter 4 explains the meaning of the risk-based approach (RBA), which should be applied when complying with this module. The RBA requires a risk-based assessment of a Relevant Personâ€™s business (in chapter 5) and its customers (in chapter 6). A risk-based assessment should be a dynamic process involving regular review, and the use of these reviews to establish the appropriate processes to match the levels of risk. No two Relevant Persons will have the same approach, and implementation of the RBA and the AML module permits a Relevant Person to design and implement systems that should be appropriate to their business and customers, with the obvious caveat being that such systems should be reasonable and proportionate in light of the AML risks. The DFSA expects the RBA to determine the breadth and depth of the Customer Due Diligence (CDD) which is undertaken for a particular customer under chapter 7, though the DFSA understands that there is an inevitable overlap between the risk-based assessment of the customer in chapter 6 and CDD in chapter 7. This overlap may occur at the initial stages of customer on-boarding but may also occur when undertaking on-going CDD.
