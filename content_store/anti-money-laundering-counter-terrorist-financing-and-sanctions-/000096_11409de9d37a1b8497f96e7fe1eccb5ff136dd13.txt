Guidance

1.

For the purposes of Rule 7.2.1(2)(a), examples of situations which might lead a Relevant Person to have doubts about the veracity or adequacy of documents, data or information previously obtained could be where there is a suspicion of money laundering in relation to that customer, where there is a material change in the way that the customer’s account is operated, which is not consistent with the customer’s business profile, or where it appears to the Relevant Person that a person other than the customer is the real customer.

2.

In Rule 7.2.2(1)(a), situations that the Relevant Person may take into account include, for example, accepting subscription monies during a short offer period or executing a time critical transaction, which if not executed immediately, would or may cause a customer to incur a financial loss due to price movement or loss of opportunity or when a customer seeks immediate insurance cover.

3. When complying with Rule 7.2.1, a Relevant Person should also, where relevant, consider Rule 7.7.1 regarding failure to conduct or complete CDD and chapter 13 regarding SARs and tipping off.
