Virtual Asset Service Providers

31.

Federal Cabinet Resolution No. 10 of 2019 applies the requirements under Federal AML legislation to Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), in addition to Financial Institutions and DNFBPs. The DFSA’s AML regime applies in addition to the Federal AML legislation. For the purposes of the DFSA’s AML regime, VASPs will typically be Authorised Firms or Authorised Market Institutions.

NFTs and Utility Tokens

32.

The DFSA excludes a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) and a Utility Token from its Crypto Token definition where such a Token meets specified criteria (see GEN A2.5). The DFSA has, however, prescribed in AML Rule 3.2.1 that a person who carries on the business or profession of issuing or providing services related to a NFT or Utility Token is a DNFBP. An exclusion applies, in the case of an issuer, if the value of each NFT or Utility Token issued is less than $15,000 and, in the case of a service provider, if the service is IT support or advice to an issuer.
