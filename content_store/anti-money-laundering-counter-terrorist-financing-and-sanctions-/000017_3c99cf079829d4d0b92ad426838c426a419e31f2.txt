The AML module cannot be read in isolation from other relevant U.A.E. legislation or developments in international policy and best practice and, to the extent applicable, Relevant Persons need to be aware of, and take into account, how these aforementioned matters may impact on the Relevant Person’s day to day operations. This is particularly relevant when considering the list of persons and terrorist organisations issued under Cabinet Decision No. 74 of 2020 and the United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) which apply in the DIFC, and unilateral sanctions imposed by other jurisdictions which may apply to a Relevant Person depending on the Relevant Person’s jurisdiction of origin, its business and/or customer base.
