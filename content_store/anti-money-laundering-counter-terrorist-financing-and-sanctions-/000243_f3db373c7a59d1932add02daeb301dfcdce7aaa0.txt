Guidance

1.

The requirements in this section apply only to a DNFBP, as other Relevant Persons are subject to similar requirements in other parts of the Rulebook – see, for example, GEN 5.4 and AUD 4.11.

2.

The DFSA expects a DNFBP to implement policies and procedures under Rule 15.3A.2 that are appropriate based on the nature, scale and complexity of the DNFBP’s business. For example, a larger or more complex DNFBP is expected to have more detailed and comprehensive policies and procedures in place.
