For a retail investment fund which is widely-held and where the investors invest via pension contributions, the DFSA would not expect the manager of the fund to look through to any underlying investors where there are none with any material control or ownership levels in the fund. However, for a closely-held fund with a small number of investors, each with a large shareholding or other interest, the DFSA would expect a Relevant Person to identify and verify each of the Beneficial Owners, depending on the risks identified as part of its risk-based assessment of the customer. For a corporate health policy with defined benefits, the DFSA would not expect a Relevant Person to identify the Beneficial Owners.
