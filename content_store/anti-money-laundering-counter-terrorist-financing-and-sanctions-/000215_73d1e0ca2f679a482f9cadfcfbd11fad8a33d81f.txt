Guidance

1.

Relevant Persons are reminded that the failure to report suspicions of money laundering or terrorist financing may constitute a criminal offence that is punishable under the laws of the State.

2.

SARs under Federal AML legislation should be sent to the FIU via the FIU’s electronic system or by other means approved by the FIU.

3.

In the preparation of a SAR, if a Relevant Person knows or assumes that the funds which form the subject of the report do not belong to a customer but to a third party, this fact and the details of the Relevant Person’s proposed course of further action in relation to the case should be included in the report.

4.

If a Relevant Person has reported a suspicion to the FIU, it must in accordance with the Federal AML legislation provide any additional information requested by the FIU. The FIU may instruct the Relevant Person on how to continue its business relationship, including effecting any transaction with a person. If the customer in question expresses his wish to move the funds before the Relevant Person receives instruction from the FIU on how to proceed, the Relevant Person should immediately contact the FIU for further instructions.
