Guidance

1.

Authorised Firms are reminded that under GEN Rule 7.5.1, the MLRO function is a mandatory appointment. For the avoidance of doubt, the individual appointed as the MLRO of an Authorised Firm, other than a Representative Office, is the same individual who holds the Licensed Function of Money Laundering Reporting Officer of that Authorised Firm. Authorised Firms are also reminded that the guidance under GEN Rule 7.5.2 sets out the grounds under which the DFSA will determine whether to grant a waiver from the residence requirements for an MLRO. The same guidance would apply by analogy to other Relevant Persons seeking a waiver from the MLRO residence requirements.

2.

The individual appointed as the MLRO of an Authorised Market Institution is the same individual who holds the position of Money Laundering Reporting Officer of that Authorised Market Institution under the relevant AMI Rule.
