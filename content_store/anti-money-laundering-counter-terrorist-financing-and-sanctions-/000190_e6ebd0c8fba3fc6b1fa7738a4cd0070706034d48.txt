In order to assist Relevant Persons, the DFSA will, from time to time, publish U.A.E., FATF or other findings, guidance, directives or sanctions. However, the DFSA expects a Relevant Person to take its own steps in acquiring relevant information from various available sources. For example, a Relevant Person may obtain relevant information from the consolidated list of sanctions in the U.A.E Cabinet, European Union Office, HM Treasury (United Kingdom) lists, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the United States Department of Treasury, as well as from sources containing lists of dual-use goods or goods subject to export control.
