Guidance on identification and verification of Beneficial Owners

4.

In determining whether an individual meets the definition of a Beneficial Owner, regard should be had to all the circumstances of the case, in particular the size of an individual’s legal or beneficial ownership in a transaction. The question of what is a “minor” ownership interest for the purposes of the definition of a Beneficial Owner in Rule 7.3.3 will depend on the individual circumstances of the customer. The DFSA considers that the question of whether an ownership interest is minor should be considered in the context of the Relevant Person’s knowledge of the customer and the customer risk assessment and the risk of money laundering.
