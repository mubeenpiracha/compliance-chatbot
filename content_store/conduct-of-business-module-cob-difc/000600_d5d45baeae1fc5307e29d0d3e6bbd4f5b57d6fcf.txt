c.

in the case of an existing Retail Client with whom the Authorised Firm has previously traded in a Crypto Token or Crypto Token Derivative, procedures to undertake a fresh appropriateness assessment if:

i.

a new Crypto Token or Crypto Token Derivative with a materially different risk profile is offered to the Retail Client; or

ii.

there has been a material change in the Retail Client’s circumstances.

4.

If an Authorised Firm forms the view that it is not appropriate for a person to trade in a Crypto Token or Crypto Token Derivative, the Authorised Firm should refrain from offering that service to the person. As a matter of good practice, the Authorised Firm should inform the person of the firm’s decision.
