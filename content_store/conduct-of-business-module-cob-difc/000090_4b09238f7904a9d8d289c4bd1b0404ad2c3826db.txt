Guidance

1.

Generally, an Authorised Firm relying on this Rule should be able to demonstrate to the DFSA the due diligence process that it had undertaken to assess whether the client classification made by its head office or other branch of the same legal entity or a member of its Group substantially meets the client classification requirements in this chapter and, if any gaps are identified, how those gaps are effectively addressed. See Rule 2.5.3, which requires the provision of unrestricted access to records for demonstrating to the DFSA due compliance with this Rule.

2.

If an Authorised Firm wishes to use any client classification undertaken by any third party other than its head office or another branch of the same legal entity, or a member of its Group, such an arrangement is generally treated as an outsourcing arrangement. Therefore, the Authorised Firm would need to meet the GEN requirements relating to outsourcing.
