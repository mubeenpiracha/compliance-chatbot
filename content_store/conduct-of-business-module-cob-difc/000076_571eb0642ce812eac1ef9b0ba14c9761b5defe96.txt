3. Where an Undertaking is set up by partners in a joint venture for the purposes of their joint venture, the Undertaking itself can be treated as a Professional Client provided a joint venture partner meets the Professional Client criteria (see Guidance paragraph 3 under Rule 2.3.5 for a description of a joint venture). To be able to rely on a joint venture partnerâ€™s Professional Client status, such a partner should generally be a key decision maker with respect to the business activities of the joint venture, and not just a silent partner. An Authorised Firm is not required to assess if an Undertaking meets the asset test referred to in Rule 2.3.8(1)(a), where the Undertaking is an industry or professional body or association i.e. a body or association that represents a particular industry sector or that oversees, or provides services to, members of a particular profession. The Authorised Firm will, however, still need to assess if the Undertaking meets the knowledge and experience requirement in Rule 2.3.8(1)(b).
