An Authorised Firm which is an ATS Operator is not required to provide best execution for Persons who are its Clients in circumstances where such Persons are dealing with each other on the Authorised Firm’s ATS and the Authorised Firm is not acting for or on behalf of any such Persons in relation to a deal on that ATS.

Requirements

In determining whether an Authorised Firm has taken reasonable care to provide the best overall price for a Client in accordance with Rule 6.4.2, the DFSA will have regard to whether an Authorised Firm has:

(a)

discounted any fees and charges previously disclosed to the Client;

(b)

not taken a Mark-up or Mark-down from the price at which it Executed the Transaction, unless this is disclosed to the Client; and

(c)

had regard to price competition or the availability of a range of price sources for the execution of its Clients’ Transactions. In the case where the Authorised Firm has access to prices of different Authorised Market trading Institutions, other regulated systems, it must Execute the Transaction at the best overall price available having considered other relevant factors.
