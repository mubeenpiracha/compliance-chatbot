Communication of information

A Credit Rating Agency must ensure that its communications relating to its Credit Ratings, Credit Rating Activities and its other business are clear, fair and not misleading.

Guidance

1.

A Credit Rating Agency should, taking into account the nature, scale and complexity of its operations, have a function within its organisation charged with the responsibility for communicating with market participants and the public on questions, concerns or complaints it receives.

2.

The objective of this function should be to help ensure that the Credit Rating Agency’s officers and management are informed of those issues that such officers and management would reasonably need to be informed about when setting and implementing the Credit Rating Agency’s systems and controls.
