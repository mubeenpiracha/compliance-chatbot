Guidance

In relation to Rule 8.8.1(3), a Credit Rating Agency should inform the Rating Subject at least 12 hours before publication of a new Credit Rating or an update or withdrawal of an existing Credit Rating of the principal grounds on which such Credit Rating is based in order to give the Rating Subject an opportunity to draw to the attention of the Credit Rating Agency any factual errors. The Rating Subject has the meaning given to it in GEN Rule 2.27.1(3) and should be read in conjunction with Rule 8.1.1(2).
