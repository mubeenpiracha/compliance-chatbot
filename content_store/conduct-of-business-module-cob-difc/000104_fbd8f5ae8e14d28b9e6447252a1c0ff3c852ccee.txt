3. Where a grandfathered Client wishes to obtain a new Financial Service after the new regime came into force, an Authorised Firm will not be able to rely on the existing client classification relating to that Client in respect of the new Financial Service. This is because Rule 2.6.1 only applies in respect of the Financial Services carried on with or for a Client before the new regime came into force. Therefore, the firm will need to make a new classification relating to such a Client in respect of the new Financial Service and do so under the new client classification regime. If an Authorised Firm becomes aware that a grandfathered professional client no longer fulfils the requirements to remain classified as a Professional Client, it will need to comply with the requirements in Rule 2.3.3(2).
