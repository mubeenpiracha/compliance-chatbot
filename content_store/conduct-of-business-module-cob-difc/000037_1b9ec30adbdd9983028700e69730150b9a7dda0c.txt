It is also possible that an Authorised Firm may provide a range of Financial Services to a single Client. If the Client can be classified as a Professional Client with regard to certain Financial Services (such as Providing Credit under the requirements in Rule 2.3.5, and similarly providing corporate structuring and financing advice or arranging credit under Rule 2.3.6), and not so with regard to other Financial Services, an Authorised Firm needs to take care that the Client is appropriately and correctly classified with respect to each Financial Service. This may mean that the same Client may receive both Professional Client treatment with regard to some Financial Services and Retail Client treatment with regard to other Financial Services. Where a Client cannot be classified as a Professional Client with regard to some Financial Services, the Authorised Firm can only provide such services to the Client if it has a Retail Endorsement on its Licence.
