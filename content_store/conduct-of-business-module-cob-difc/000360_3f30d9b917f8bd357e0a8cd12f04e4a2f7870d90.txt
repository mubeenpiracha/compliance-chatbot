Guidance

1.

The period of 30 days will commence to run from the time the DFSA has received all the relevant information to assess the application.

2.

An ATS Operator should consider submitting its application for the DFSA approval well in advance of the date on which a proposed amendment is intended to come into effect, especially in the case of significant material changes to its existing arrangements, to allow the DFSA sufficient time to consider the application. If additional time is reasonably required to properly assess the impact of a proposed change due to its nature, scale and complexity, the DFSA may make an appropriate extension of time beyond 30 days. Such an extension would be made in consultation with the applicant.
