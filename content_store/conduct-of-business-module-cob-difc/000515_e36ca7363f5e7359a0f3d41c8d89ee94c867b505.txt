the administration costs of the Scheme.

(2) Where a Participating Employer makes a payment under (1), the Operator must use that payment to defray the administrative costs of the Scheme on Member contributions.

Guidance

The payments referred to in Rule 12.3.6(1) are voluntary payments a Participating Employer may make, over and above Member contributions in respect of its Employeesâ€™ gratuity. If such payments are made, the Operator needs to ensure that they are used for defraying costs borne by Members, rather than treated as additional contributions available for investment.
