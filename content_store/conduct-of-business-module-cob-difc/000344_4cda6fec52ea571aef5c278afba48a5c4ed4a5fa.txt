(a)

whether the Credit Rating Agency or any member of its Group receives any fees, charges or other monetary benefits which are unrelated to the provision by the Credit Rating Agency of its Credit Ratings, and if so, the proportion of such benefits relating to the aggregate fees and charges in respect of the provision of Credit Ratings; and

(b)

if the Credit Rating Agency receives 10% or more of its aggregate annual revenue from a single Rating Subject or its Related Party, information about that source.

Where a Credit Rating Agency is a member of a Group, the 10% aggregate annual income referred to in (1)(b) may be calculated by aggregating the net revenue of all Credit Rating Agencies within the Group.
