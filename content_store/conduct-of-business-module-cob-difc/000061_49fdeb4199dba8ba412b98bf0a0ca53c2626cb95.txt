Joint ventures are generally contractual arrangements under which parties contribute their assets and/or expertise to develop or to undertake specified business activities. An Undertaking can be set up by a number of joint venture partners for obtaining credit for use in the ordinary course of their joint venture business. Although joint venture partners would themselves not have a controlling interest in the joint venture, as credit is obtained for use in the joint venture business, they have the benefit of the professional client status available to the Undertaking under Rule 2.3.5.
