Rule 2.3.1(2) allows an Authorised Firm to classify a Client as a Retail Client in respect of some Financial Services and a Professional Client in respect of other Financial Services. For example, a Client classified as a ‘service-based’ Professional Client under Rule 2.3.5 for the Financial Service of Providing Credit may not necessarily meet the criteria to be classified as an ‘assessed’ Professional Client under Rule 2.3.7 or Rule 2.3.8 in respect of any other Financial Service to be provided to that Client. Therefore, such a Client would need to be classified as a Retail Client with respect to Financial Services other than Providing Credit.
