Insurance

Intermediary must, before providing any

Guidance

1. An Insurance Intermediary should not represent itself as providing advice or information on the basis of a fair analysis of the market under Rule 7.5.3(1) unless it has considered a sufficiently broad range of Contracts of Insurance and based its decision on an adequate analysis of those contracts. Insurance Brokers act for Clients who are Policyholders. In doing so, they may claim under Rule 7.5.3(3) that they act ‘independently’ for the Clients.
