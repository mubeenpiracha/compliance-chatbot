actual value, price or level of an underlying reference factor referred to in the Derivative contract.

3. The types of Derivatives which fall within the definition of a Restricted Speculative Investment may have labels such as ‘turbo certificates’, ‘knock out options’ and ‘delta options’. Where a contract has similar features to the contracts listed in Rule 6.16.2(e)(i), (ii) or (iii), it will also be subject to the requirements of this section (if offered or marketed to a Retail Client). In determining whether a contract is a Restricted Speculative Investment, the DFSA will look at the substance of an arrangement, as opposed to its mere form.
