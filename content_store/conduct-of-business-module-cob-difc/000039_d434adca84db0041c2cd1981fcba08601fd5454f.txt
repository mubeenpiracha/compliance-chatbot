10. Rule 2.4.4 provides a degree of flexibility for an Authorised Firm which is a Branch operation or member of a Group to rely on client classifications made by its head office or any other branch of the same legal entity, or by a member of its Group. Where such reliance is placed, the Authorised Firm should be able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the DFSA that the reliance is reasonable because the applicable requirements are substantially similar and, where this is not the case, any identified differences (i.e. gaps) are suitably addressed to enable the firm to meet its obligations relating to client classification under this chapter. It is also possible that an Authorised Firm which is a member of a Group may have some Clients to whom it provides Financial Services as a Retail Client, whilst other Group members may provide Financial Services to the same Client as a Professional Client. While an Authorised Firm may rely on the client classifications made by a Group member under Rule 2.4.4, it is the responsibility of the firm to ensure that the correct classification is adopted by it for the purposes of the Financial Services it provides to the Client (see Rule 2.4.4).
