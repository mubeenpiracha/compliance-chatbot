1. Where a Credit Rating Agency undertakes activities in a number of jurisdictions, the effect of Rule 8.4.1 is that it will need to ensure that respective obligations arising in all those jurisdictions are effectively met as appropriate. In doing so, it will need to take account of the application of the DFSA regime to Group and Branch operations (see Guidance 1 and 2 under Rule 8.3.1). A Credit Rating Agency is required, under GEN Rule 7.5.1(2), to have an Authorised Individual as its Compliance Officer. It is the responsibility of the Compliance Officer to ensure proper observance by the Credit Rating Agency and its Employees, particularly Rating Analysts, of the applicable legal and other obligations, including any code of conduct/ethics adopted by the Credit Rating Agency. Such a code should generally set out matters relating to unacceptable and unethical behaviour which should be avoided by its Employees. See also Guidance 2 under section 8.1.1.
