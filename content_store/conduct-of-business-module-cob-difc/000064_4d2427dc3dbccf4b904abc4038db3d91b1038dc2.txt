Guidance

1.

This Rule enables an Authorised Firm to classify a Person obtaining advice or arranging credit for the purposes of corporate structuring and financing as a Professional Client based on the nature of such activities, which are generally sought by Persons with greater expertise and resources than Retail Clients. Such advice and arranging occurs in the context of takeovers and merger activities and capital raising activities of companies, including any Initial Public Offerings or other offers of securities for capital raising purposes.

2.

If a Client seeking corporate structuring and financing services is also a Person who falls within the category of a ‘deemed’ Professional Client under Rule 2.3.4, an Authorised Firm may provide to such a Person those services without having to meet the requirements in Rule 2.3.6.
