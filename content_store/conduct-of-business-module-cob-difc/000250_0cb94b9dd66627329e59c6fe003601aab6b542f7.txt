Guidance

An Authorised Firm needs to carry out proper due diligence to satisfy itself, on reasonable grounds, that Restricted Speculative Investments offered by a non-DIFC issuer are subject to substantially similar requirements to those that apply under this section. This due diligence needs to be undertaken before carrying on the relevant service with or for the Retail Client. The Authorised Firm should be able to demonstrate to the DFSA the basis upon which it has reasonably concluded that the requirements are substantially similar, even if they are not identical.
