Guidance

1.

Under Rule 2.6.3, the net asset test referred to in Rule 2.3.7(1)(a) remains $500,000 until 1 April 2016.

2.

An individual can generally only be classified as a Professional Client if he meets the requirements in Rule 2.3.7(1) or (3). This is because all the other criteria relevant to Professional Clients in this chapter apply to Undertakings and not to individuals, with the possible exception of a trustee of a trust under Rule 2.3.4(j).

3.

An individual classified as a Professional Client may operate a joint account with more than one family member. Under the general principle of interpretation that the singular includes the plural, provided each such family member meets the requirements set out in Rule 2.3.7(3), they can all be classified as Professional Clients.

4.

A legal structure or vehicle of a Professional Client, which is itself classified as a Professional Client under Rule 2.3.7(2), does not have a right to opt-in as a Retail Client, as that right belongs to the Professional Client for whose purposes the vehicle is set up.
