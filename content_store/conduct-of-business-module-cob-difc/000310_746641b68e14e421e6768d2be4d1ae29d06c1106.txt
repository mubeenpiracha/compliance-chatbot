Guidance

1.

A Credit Rating Agency will need to establish proper procedures for the regular review of its methodologies and models, including any key rating assumptions used in such methodologies and models, in order to be able to properly assess the Relevant Information and prepare credible and high quality Credit Ratings. Any changes to the methodologies and models should incorporate cumulative experience gained through on-going market surveillance.

2. Where any material modifications are made to the methodologies or models used by the Credit Rating Agency, it should make prior disclosure to the public of such modifications before applying the modified methodologies and models, especially to existing Credit Ratings.

3.

A Credit Rating Agency should assess whether existing methodologies and models for providing a Credit Rating in respect of structured financial products remain appropriate where the risk characteristics of the assets underlying a structured product change materially.
