Considerations set out in Guidance No 1 and 2 are equally relevant to the other requirements applicable to CRAs which are set out in this chapter.

Periodic review

4.

A Credit Rating Agency should ensure that there is a formal and rigorous periodic review (at least annually) of the effectiveness of its systems and controls, including the methodologies and models it uses, to ensure that they remain effective and adequate in light of factors such as changing market conditions and practices and matters that have a material impact on the users of Credit Ratings.

5.

Such a review should be carried out by individuals who are not involved in the day-to-day management or operations of the Credit Rating Agency. Taking into account the nature, scale and complexity of its business, a Credit Rating Agency may undertake such a review through a designated function at the group-wide level, or using external consultants. The DFSA expects the findings of such a review to be made available to the Governing Body and the senior management of the Credit Rating Agency, and that any inadequacies identified are promptly and effectively addressed.
