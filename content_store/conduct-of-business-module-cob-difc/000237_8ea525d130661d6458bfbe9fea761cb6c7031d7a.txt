Guidance

1.

The warning required under Rule 6.16.5 is different to the risk warning required under Rule 6.16.4. The latter applies only to an Authorised Firm that Deals in a Restricted Speculative Investment with a Retail Client. The requirement in Rule 6.16.5 is more general and applies to all communications made by any Authorised Firm that:

(a) deals in Restricted Speculative Investments, whether as principal or as agent;

(b) advises on Restricted Speculative Investments; or

(c) arranges deals in Restricted Speculative Investments.

2.

These requirements supplement the overarching obligations applicable to an Authorised Firm under GEN Rules 3.2.1 and 4.2.6.
