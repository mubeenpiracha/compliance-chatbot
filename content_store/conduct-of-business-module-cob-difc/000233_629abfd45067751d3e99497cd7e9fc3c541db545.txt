Guidance

1.

The provision of a risk warning in good time before opening an account for a Retail Client to trade in Restricted Speculative Investments under Rule 6.16.4(2) is intended to give a Retail Client sufficient time to consider the information in the risk warning and to be able to make an informed decision before agreeing to obtain the relevant service from the Authorised Firm.

2.

An Authorised Firm should be able to demonstrate that the risk warning required under Rule 6.16.4 has been provided to the Retail Client, for example, through a record of emails or other communications sent to the Retail Client (see also Rule 6.16.14).

3.

The ratio of Retail Client accounts that made a loss as against the Authorised Firmâ€™s total number of accounts referred to in Rule 6.16.4(3)(b) and (4) should present a fair and balanced view of all the relevant retail accounts operated by the Authorised Firm or, where relevant, its Group members. The data should not be used on a selective basis to create a misleading impression (i.e. not cherry picked).
