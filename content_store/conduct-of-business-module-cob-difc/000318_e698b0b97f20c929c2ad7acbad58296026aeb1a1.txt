Guidance

1.

A Credit Rating Agency may use separate teams of Rating Analysts for determining initial Credit Ratings and subsequent review of such ratings. It should ensure that each team has the requisite level of expertise and resources to perform its functions effectively.

2.

A Credit Rating Agency should undertake both periodic and ad hoc reviews of its Credit Ratings as appropriate to the nature of the Rating Subject, the market conditions and reasonable expectations of users of such Credit Ratings. Such reviews should apply any changes in its rating methodologies and models, including rating assumptions.

3.

A Credit Rating Agency should have clear and published parameters relating to the review of Credit Ratings, including, to the extent possible, when it will undertake any ad hoc reviews. Such parameters should include any material change in the risk characteristics of the Rating Subject or significant changes in the markets which relate to, or affect, the Rating Subject.
