Guidance

1.

A Credit Rating Agency should neither take, nor forbear or refrain from taking, any Rating Action based on its potential effect (economic, political or otherwise) on the Credit Rating Agency, its Rating Subjects, investors or any other market participants (for example, the existence or non-existence of business relationship between the Credit Rating Agency or a member of its Group and the Rating Subject).

2.

The determination of a Credit Rating should be influenced only by factors relevant to the credit assessment in accordance with its published methodologies and models as applicable to the particular Rating Subject.

3.

A Credit Rating Agency should, at a minimum, set out clearly when conflicts of interest arise and, in relation to what type of business or commercial dealings or transactions, and between whom, such conflicts of interest can arise.
