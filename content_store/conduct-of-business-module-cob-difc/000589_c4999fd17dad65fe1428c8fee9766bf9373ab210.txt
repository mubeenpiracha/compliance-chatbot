(6)

If an Authorised Firm gives a Person a key features document prepared by another Person, the Authorised Firm remains legally accountable to the Person to whom it is given for the content of the document.

(7)

This Rule does not apply to an Authorised Firm that Operates a MTF that trades Crypto Tokens.

Guidance

Rule 15.5.1 does not apply to an MTF Operator, as the MTF Operator is separately required under Rule 15.3.1 to publish a key features document before the relevant Crypto Token is traded on the MTF.
