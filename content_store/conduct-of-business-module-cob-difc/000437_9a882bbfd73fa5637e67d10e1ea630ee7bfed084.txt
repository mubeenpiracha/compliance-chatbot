Rule 11.3.2 does not apply to Property Investment Crowdfunding due to the different nature of the Investment i.e. the Investment is in a property rather than a business or project.

6.

In compiling information relating to loan defaults, a Loan Crowdfunding Operator is expected to:

(a) consider loans where it reasonably believes full repayment is unlikely, regardless of

whether the loan is currently past the due date or not; and

(b) treat loans that are over 90 days past the due date as being in default.

7.

In order to meet the requirements in Rule 11.3.2 (3), the Loan Crowdfunding Operator should measure the number of days past the due date from the earliest contractual date on which a payment is due but has not been made.
