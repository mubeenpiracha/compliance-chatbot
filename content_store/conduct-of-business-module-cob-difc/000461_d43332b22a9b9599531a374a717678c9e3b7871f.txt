11.3.9

CONDUCT OF BUSINESS (COB)

2.

If an Investment proposal is advertised to Persons who are not Clients of the operator, in addition to breaching Rule 11.3.8, this may constitute an Offer of Securities to the Public that requires a Prospectus, as the offer may no longer meet the conditions of the Exempt Offer exclusion for Crowdfunding Platforms in MKT Rule 2.3.1(m).

3.

In the DFSA’s view, an advertisement containing only the limited information specified in Rule 11.3.8(2) about a proposal would not by itself constitute an Offer of Securities to the Public that requires a Prospectus.

4.

Rule 11.3.8 does not prevent an operator from generally promoting its crowdfunding service to potential Clients, provided it does not advertise a specific proposal.
