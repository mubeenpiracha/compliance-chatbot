Conflicts of interest and independence

Guidance

1.

There is a significant overlap between conflicts of interest and lack of independence of Employees (who include Rating Analysts). Therefore, some of the requirements set out in this section, while promoting independence of Credit Rating Agencies, are equally relevant for the purpose of addressing conflicts of interest. For convenience, they are set out under distinct headings.

2.

The more detailed requirements set out in this section are designed to enable a Credit Rating Agency to meet the requirements set out under COB Rule 8.2.2 (Principle 2 â€“ Independence and transparency). For this purpose, a Credit Rating Agency should have a detailed code of conduct/ethics that sets out its policies and procedures for meeting the requirements including those in this module covering aspects relating to conflicts of interest, as well as independence, of its Employees. See also Guidance 2 under section 8.1.1.
