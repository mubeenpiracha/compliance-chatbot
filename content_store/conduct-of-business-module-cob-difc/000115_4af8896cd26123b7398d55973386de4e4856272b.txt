enter into a Client Agreement as soon as practicable thereafter.

Guidance

1.

App 2 sets out the core information that must be included in every Client Agreement and additional disclosure for certain types of activities to which this chapter applies. The information content for Client Agreements with Retail Clients is more detailed than for Professional Clients.

2.

For the purposes of Rule 3.3.2(1)(b), an Authorised Firm may either provide a Person with a copy of the proposed Client Agreement, or give that information in a separate form. If there are any changes to the terms and conditions of the proposed agreement, the Authorised Firm should ensure that the Client Agreement to be signed with the Person accurately incorporates those changes.

3.

For the purposes of Rule 3.3.2(2)(a), an Authorised Firm may consider it is reasonably impracticable to provide the key information to a Person if that Person requests the Authorised Firm to execute a Transaction on a time critical basis. Where an Authorised Firm has given the explanation referred to in Rule 3.3.2(3)(a) verbally, it should maintain records to demonstrate to the DFSA that it has provided that information to the Client.
