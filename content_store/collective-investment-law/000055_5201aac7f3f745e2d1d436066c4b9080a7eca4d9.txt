Reinstatement

(1) Where a Public Fund has been deregistered, an application for the

reinstatement of the Fund may be made to the Court by:

(a)

a person aggrieved by the deregistration; or

(b)

a person who was winding up the Fund.

(2)

Upon such application, the Court may, if it is satisfied that it is just and equitable to do so:

(a)

make an order that the DFSA reinstate the registration of the Fund: and

(b)

give any directions it thinks just for putting the Fund and other persons in the same position, as far as possible, as if the Fund had not been deregistered.
