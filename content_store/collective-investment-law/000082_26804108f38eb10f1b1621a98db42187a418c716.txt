Recognition and designation

(1)

The DFSA may recognise any country or territory and designate any type of Fund constituted and domiciled in such a country or territory for the purposes of this Law.

(2)

The DFSA may not recognise any country or territory nor designate any Fund in that country or territory for the purposes of this Article unless it is satisfied:

(a)

that the law and practice under which the relevant Foreign Fund is authorised or approved and supervised in that country or territory is broadly equivalent to the DFSA’s regulatory regime as it applies to Domestic Funds;

(b)

that the law and practice under which fund managers and eligible custodians are authorised or licenced and supervised in that country or territory is broadly equivalent to the DFSA’s regulatory regime as it applies to such a person; and

(c)

that adequate arrangements exist, or will exist, for co-operation between the Regulator in that country or territory, responsible for such authorisation, licensing, approval and supervision and the DFSA.
