Where prices are obtained otherwise than from the main pricing source (e.g. unquoted, suspended, or illiquid stocks), the Fund Manager should maintain a record of the source and basis for the value placed on the investment. These should be regularly reviewed. A system should be in place to ensure that investment and borrowing powers which are contained in the Rules, where applicable and in the Fund's Constitution and Prospectus are not breached, and that if breaches occur they are identified and rectified.

A system should be in place to ensure that dividends are accounted for as soon as stocks are quoted ex-dividend, unless, as with some foreign stocks, it is prudent to account for them only on receipt. Fixed interest dividends and interest should be accrued at each point unless the level of materiality makes a longer interval appropriate. Similar considerations apply to the expenses of the Fund.
