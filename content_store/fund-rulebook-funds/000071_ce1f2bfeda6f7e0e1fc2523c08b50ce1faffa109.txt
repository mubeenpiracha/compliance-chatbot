Public Fund Prospectus

(a)

the information in APP 7;

(b)

if it is a specialist class of a Public Fund, any information as is relevant to that specialist class of Fund; and

Guidance

The disclosure requirements relating to a Prospectus that apply to a Public Fund are somewhat more extensive than the Prospectus disclosure requirements that apply to other types of Funds, in particular, Exempt Funds and Qualified Investor Funds.
