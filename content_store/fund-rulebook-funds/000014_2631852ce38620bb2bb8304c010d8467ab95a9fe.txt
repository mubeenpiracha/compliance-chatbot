Supplementary and Replacement Prospectuses

Guidance

1.

Rule 9.3.1(3) requires a Fund Manager to issue, if, at any time after the issue of a Prospectus there is a material change affecting any matter contained in the Prospectus or a significant new matter arises, a Supplementary or a Replacement Prospectus in the manner prescribed in these Rules.

2.

Any reference in FSMR and these Rules to a Prospectus includes an offering document of an Exempt Fund or of a Qualified Investor Fund and any Supplementary or Replacement Prospectus, unless otherwise provided. Accordingly, all requirements that apply to a Prospectus apply equally to each of those documents except where stated otherwise.

(1) Where a Fund Manager, for the purpose of Rule 9.3.1(3), issues a Supplementary Prospectus, the Fund Manager must:

(a)

clearly identify in the Supplementary Prospectus the Prospectus that it supplements, the revisions to that Prospectus, the date of any material change or new matter giving rise to any revision, and the date of the document which must be the date of filing with the Regulator;

(b)

if it is a Public Fund, file a copy with the Regulator;

(c)

provide a copy to each Person who applied for, but has not yet been issued with, Units under the previous Prospectus after the earliest date of any material change or new matter giving rise to the revision; and

(d)

ensure the Supplementary Prospectus is made available in the same media and through the same channels as, and together with, the previous Prospectus.

(2) Where a Fund Manager, for the purpose of Rule 9.3.1(3), issues a Replacement Prospectus, the Fund Manager must:

(a)

clearly state that it is a Replacement Prospectus, and identify the Prospectus that it replaces, the date and nature of any material change or new matter giving rise to the replacement, the expiry date, and the date of the document which must be the date of filing with the Regulator;

(b)

if it is a Public Fund, file a copy with the Regulator; and

(c)

provide a copy to each Person who applied for, but has not yet been issued with, Units under the previous Prospectus after the earliest date of any material change or new matter giving rise to the replacement.

(a)

inform any Person who applied for, but has not yet been issued with, Units on the basis of the previous Prospectus after the earliest date of a material change or new matter giving rise to the issue of the Supplementary Prospectus or Replacement Prospectus of their right to confirm or retract any application made on the basis of that Prospectus and to obtain a refund of monies paid, and the manner in which to do so; and

(b)

allow any such Person a period of at least seven days from the date of receipt of the Supplementary Prospectus or Replacement Prospectus in which to so confirm or retract his application.
