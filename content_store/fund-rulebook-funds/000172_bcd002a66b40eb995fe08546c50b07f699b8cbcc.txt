Guidance

1.

The Guidance under APP 6 sets out matters which a Fund Manager should take into account when assessing the fitness and propriety of an individual who is to be appointed to carry out the Fund's oversight function.

2.

In the case of a Trustee or Eligible Custodian appointed to provide the oversight function, a Fund Manager should, before making such an appointment, identify the most senior individuals within the organisation who will carry the primary responsibility for the oversight function. The suitability assessment should then be applied to each such individual.
