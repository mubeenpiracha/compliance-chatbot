1.

If an Exempt Fund can no longer meet the relevant conditions set out in Rule 3.3.3 to be classified as an Exempt Fund, the Fund Manager of that Fund is required, under Section 112 of FSMR, to apply for the winding up of that Fund. Alternatively, the Fund Manager may have that Fund moved to the classification of a Public Fund, which requires the satisfaction of the requirements and formalities specific to that type of Fund. An Exempt Fund may also, if it wishes to, convert to a Qualified Investor Fund provided it meets the conditions applicable to a Qualified Investor Fund in Rule 3.3.4.
