Custody of Fund Property

15.3.1

(1) The Fund Manager of a Qualified Investor Fund that is not an Investment Trust must ensure that the legal title to Fund Property is registered with an Eligible Custodian.

(2) The requirement in (1) does not apply in relation to Fund Property where it is impracticable and disproportionate to comply with that Rule given the nature of the Fund and its assets, provided that the Fund Manager has in place effective arrangements which ensure that the Fund Property is not available to creditors in the event of the insolvency of the Fund Manager.
