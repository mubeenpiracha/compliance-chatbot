Rules 4.1.3 and 4.1.4 exclude from being treated as Offers any Transactions undertaken by an Authorised Firm where such Transactions are Execution-only Transactions, or Transactions for the purposes of managing a Discretionary Portfolio for a Client, or for the purposes of redeeming a Unit of a Fund for a Client. Similarly, an offer made by an Authorised Firm to a Market Counterparty is also excluded from being an Offer. Finally, Rule 4.1.5 excludes an offer of a Unit of a Passported Fund from being treated as an Offer where the DIFC is the Host Jurisdiction. This is because such an offer will be subject to the requirements in the Home Jurisdiction. As a result, such excluded Transactions and offers do not attract the marketing prohibition in Article 19 of the Law and the requirements in both the Law and this module relating to the marketing of Units.
