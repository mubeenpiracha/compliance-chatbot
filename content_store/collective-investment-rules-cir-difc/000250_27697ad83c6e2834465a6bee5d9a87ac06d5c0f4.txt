Exempt Fund Prospectus

Guidance

The disclosure requirements relating to a Prospectus that apply to an Exempt Fund are different from the Prospectus disclosure required for Public Funds. As Prospectus disclosure is a matter closely linked to the marketing of Units of Funds, Prospectus requirements relating to the relevant types of Funds are set out in chapter 14.
