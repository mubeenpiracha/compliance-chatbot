the functions of Fund valuation and asset pricing; and

(b)

the investment management process.

(2) Where the Fund manager is unable to demonstrate adequate separation and independence in accordance with (1), the DFSA may require the Fund Manager to appoint an independent, suitably competent and experienced Fund Administrator to perform the functions specified in (1)(a).

Guidance

To provide segregation of the net asset value determination process of the Fund from the investment management process, generally personnel involved in the former should not be involved in the latter. An effective method of achieving such segregation is to delegate the calculation, determination and production of the net asset value to a suitably competent and experienced third party Fund Administrator.
