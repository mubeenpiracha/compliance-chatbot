Guidance

Rule 13.9.3 requires an ETF to track the performance of an index or benchmark. It therefore does not permit a Fund that is ‘actively managed’ to be established as an ETF. For more discussion about actively managed Funds – see the Guidance after Rule 13.9.6.

Criteria for underlying indices or other benchmarks

(1) A Fund Manager of an ETF may use an index or other benchmark for the purposes referred to in Rule 13.9.3 only if it is provided by a Price Information Provider that meets the requirements in App 9.

(2)

In (1), a Price Information Provider is a price reporting agency or an index or benchmark provider which constructs, compiles, assesses or reports, on a regular and systematic basis, prices of Investments, Crypto Tokens, rates, indices, commodities or figures, which are made available to users, including a Fund Manager.

Index or benchmark provided by a Related Party

The Fund Manager of an ETF must treat an arrangement between the Fund Manager and a Related Party to use an index or benchmark provided by the Related Party as a Related Party Transaction.
