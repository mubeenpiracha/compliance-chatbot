Guidance

The investment policy of a Public Fund can provide a wide or restrictive spread of risk, provided it is consistent with the investment objectives and policy of the Fund as stated in the most recently published Fund Prospectus of that Fund. For example, if a Fundâ€™s investment objectives and policy are to invest in a single asset (a single property Fund), or a single asset class (e.g. shares in emerging markets) or a single sector (mining or technology) that policy must be properly disclosed in the Prospectus, along with the risks associated in the particular asset or asset class. See also the additional disclosure required under Rules 14.4.3 and 14.4.4 in the Prospectus of a Public Fund that is a Property Fund.
