If a Fund Manager of a Venture Capital Fund obtains the services of special advisers, for example, to select venture capital businesses to invest in, or to monitor their on-going performance, those advisers should not be held out as being an investment committee of the type referred to in Rule 13.3.1. Such a description would be misleading, unless the Fund Manager chooses to follow the requirements in that Rule.
