Systems should be in place whereby all transactions are confirmed in writing or by electronic means to the Fund Manager or to a pricing agent as quickly as possible. It is desirable that all deals to which the Fund is committed, which have been notified, at most, one hour before a valuation, are included in that valuation, at estimated prices if necessary. Unless, however, there is likely to be significant movement in a price of a Unit, it is more important that an accurate cut-off procedure is in place to ensure that omissions or duplications do not take place, than it is to ensure that estimates are included in a valuation.

Where prices are obtained otherwise than from the main pricing source (e.g. unquoted, suspended, or illiquid stocks), the Fund Manager should maintain a record of the source and basis for the value placed on the investment. These should be regularly reviewed.

A system should be in place to ensure that investment and borrowing powers which are contained in the Rules, where applicable and in the Fundâ€™s Constitution and Prospectus are not breached, and that if breaches occur they are identified and rectified.
