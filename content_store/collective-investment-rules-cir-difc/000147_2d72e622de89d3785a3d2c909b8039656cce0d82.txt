Guidance

1.

Refer to Article 18A(2) of the Law for the definition of an Open-ended Fund.

2.

The Prospectus of a Public Fund is required to set out, among other things, the dealing days and times in the dealing day on which the Fund Manager will receive requests for the sale and redemption of Units and also, redemption procedures. The Constitution or offer documents (i.e. the Information Memorandum) of an Open-ended Exempt Fund or QIF may specify the Fundâ€™s dealing days, but where it does not do so, the maximum period between dealing days will depend on the reasonable expectations of the target investor group and the particular investment objectives and policy of the Fund.

3.

Capital reductions or share buy-backs that occur in a Closed-ended Fund are not treated as redemptions and resales of Units of Funds based on NAV in the same manner as occurs in the case of an Open-ended Fund as provided in these Rules. See Article 18A(3) of the Law for the definition of a Closed-ended Fund.
