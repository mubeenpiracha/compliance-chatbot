Guidance

1.

Section 8.12 of this module governs the power of a Fund Manager to delegate certain of its Financial Service activities, and to outsource its functions.

2.

Where a Fund invests in infrastructure projects (for example, the development of public facilities such as roads, railways or bridges), the interest acquired by the Fund may not necessarily be suited to the conventional forms of holding custody of Real Property. Where this is the case, a Fund Manager may use adequate alternative custody arrangements that meet the requirements in CIR 8.2.2(3)(c)(2)(ii).
