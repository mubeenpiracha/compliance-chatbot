Guidance

1.

A Fund in the DIFC is, except as specified in GEN Rule 3A.2.1(3), only permitted to invest in a Recognised Crypto Token i.e. a Crypto Token that the DFSA has recognised under GEN section 3A.

2.

A “Price Information Provider” is a price reporting agency or an index or benchmark provider which constructs, compiles, assesses or reports, on a regular and systematic basis, prices of Investments, Crypto Tokens, rates, indices, commodities or figures, which are made available to users, including a Fund Manager – see the definition in Rule 13.9.4.

3.

The requirement in Rule 13.13.2 applies to a Fund that has any Fund Property that consists of Crypto Tokens. That is, it does not apply only to a Fund which has investing in Crypto Tokens as its main purpose (i.e. a Crypto Token Fund).
