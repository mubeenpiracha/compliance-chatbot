Guidance

GEN Rule 4.2.12 (Principle 12) requires an Authorised Firm to have remuneration structures and strategies which are well aligned with the long term interests of the firm, and are appropriate to the nature, scale and complexity of its business. That requirement is extended under Rule 8.3.1(3) to cover remuneration practices relating to Funds which a Fund Manager manages.
