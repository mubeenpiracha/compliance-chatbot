Guidance

1.

A Fund Manager must carry out the due diligence required under Rule 13.8.2 as part of its internal procedures. However, this does not prevent it from using a service provider to carry out the necessary due diligence, provided the outsourcing requirements in these Rules are met.

2.

A Fund Manager will not meet the due diligence requirements in the Rule if it relies solely on credit ratings issued by a credit rating agency. This is because assessment of credit quality is only part of the due diligence required under the Rule.

3.

A Fund Manager should keep appropriate records of the due diligence it has conducted on an Investment to demonstrate that it has complied with the Rule.
