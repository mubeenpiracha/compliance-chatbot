Guidance

1.

The stress testing programme for a Credit Fund should, among other things, identify possible events or future changes in economic conditions that could have unfavourable effects on the Fund’s credit exposures and assess the Fund’s ability to withstand such changes.

2.

The DFSA is likely to review the results of stress testing during the initial stages of a Fund’s operation and then on an ad hoc basis once the Fund becomes established.
