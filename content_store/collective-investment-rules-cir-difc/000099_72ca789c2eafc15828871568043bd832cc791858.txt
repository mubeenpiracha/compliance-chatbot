the Incorporated Cell Company (see Rule 6A.1.3).

Incorporated Cell Companies and Protected Cell Companies

6.

While both Incorporated Cell Companies (ICCs) and Protected Cell Companies (PCCs) have a similar structure as both have a ‘core’ containing the infrastructure to manage their ‘cells’, there is a significant difference between an ICC and a PCC. Unlike a cell of a PCC, each Incorporated Cell of an ICC is a separate legal entity operating under its own name and with its own directors and Articles of Association. Under the ICC Regulations, an Incorporated Cell is not a subsidiary of the ICC. By contrast, a PCC and its cells form a single Fund, with each cell being a Sub-Fund of the PCC.

A Fund Manager wishing to offer different investment strategies within a Single Fund (e.g. an Umbrella Fund) and different asset classes within its Sub-Funds to investors who can freely switch their investment strategies, can use the PCC structure. A Fund Manager wishing to manage different types or specialist classes of Funds, which are separate legal entities, using the infrastructure available in the core, can only do so by establishing an ICC.
