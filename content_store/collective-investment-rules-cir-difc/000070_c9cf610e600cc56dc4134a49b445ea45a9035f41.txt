Guidance

1.

A Venture Capital Fund is expected to finance small to medium sized businesses which are in the early stages of business development and growth. Some business ventures would be using innovative technologies or new ways of doing business. However, where an established large-scale business spins off subsidiaries to expand existing businesses and operations, this would not be considered to be a start-up or small to medium sized business in which a Venture Capital Fund should invest.

2.

The term “committed capital” refers to the total amount that Unitholders have agreed to contribute to the Venture Capital Fund.

3.

A business venture is “unlisted” if it does not have securities admitted to an official list of securities of an exchange, or admitted to trading on a MTF or an OTF.
