Guidance

1.

A Fund Manager of an External Fund is generally not subject to the requirements that otherwise apply to other Domestic Funds (see Article 14(2) of the Law). However, some limited requirements apply to External Funds. See for example the requirements referred to in Guidance note (2) below and the disclosure required under Rules 14.2.4 â€“ 14.2.7. Should such a requirement conflict with any requirements that apply to an External Fund in the jurisdiction in which the Fund is domiciled, the Fund Manager may apply to the DFSA for appropriate waivers or modifications of the DFSA requirements.
