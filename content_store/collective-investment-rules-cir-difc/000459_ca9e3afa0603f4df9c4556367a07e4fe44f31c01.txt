(3) Where the Fund Manager or Trustee and one or more Unitholders agree, the requirement of (2) to realise the Fund Property does not apply to that part of the property proportionate to the entitlement of such Unitholders. The Fund Manager or Trustee may distribute that part in the form of property, after making adjustments or retaining provisions as appear to the Fund Manager or Trustee appropriate for ensuring that, that or those Unitholders bear a proportional share of the liabilities and costs.

(4)

The Fund Manager or Trustee must as soon as practical after the winding up or termination has commenced:

(a)

if the Unitholders have not initiated the winding up under Article 63 of the Law, inform the Unitholders of the winding up or termination; and

(b)

publish a notice of the winding up or termination in one English and one Arabic language national newspaper and if the Fund has a website, on the Fundâ€™s website.
