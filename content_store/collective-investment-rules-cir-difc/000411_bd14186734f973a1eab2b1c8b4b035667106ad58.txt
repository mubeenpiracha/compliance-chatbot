Guidance

1. An Information Memorandum issued by a Fund Manager of a Venture Capital Fund is a

Prospectus (see Article 50(3)(a) of the Law).

2. The obligation under Article 52(2) of the Law for a Prospectus to include “all the information which an investor would reasonably require and expect to find in a prospectus to make an informed decision to become a member of the Fund” will, among other things, require disclosure of any inherent risks in the proposed investment strategy and the types of investments proposed. If the proposed investment strategy or the types of investment instruments of the Fund are complex, we expect the Prospectus to alert potential investors for the need to seek professional advice. Prospectus sets out clearly any legal requirements that ordinarily apply to Fund Managers and their Funds, but which are, by DFSA Rules, disapplied to the Fund Manager in relation to the Venture Capital Fund.
