For more information about the procedures and requirements for a Passported Fund, see

the Fund Protocol Rules (FPR).

If a Passported Fund is established or domiciled in one of the other UAE jurisdictions, many of the requirements in this module do not apply to the Fund as it is a Foreign Fund rather than a Domestic Fund (as those terms are defined in the Law). Only certain requirements in this module apply to Foreign Funds (e.g. Chapter 15: marketing of Foreign Funds). Instead, the Passported Fund will need to comply with the requirements in its Home Jurisdiction, including the relevant Fund Protocol rules or regulations made by its Home Regulator.
