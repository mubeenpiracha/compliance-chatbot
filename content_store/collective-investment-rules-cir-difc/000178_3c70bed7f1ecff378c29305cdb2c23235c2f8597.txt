Payments of liabilities on transfer of assets

8.13.8 Where the property of a Body Corporate or of another Fund is transferred to a Fund or to the Fund Manager for the account of the Fund or to the Trustee to hold on trust for the Unitholders in consideration of the issue of Units in the Fund to Unitholders in that Body Corporate or in that other Fund, Rule 8.13.9 applies.

8.13.9

The Fund Manager or in the case of an Investment Trust, the Trustee, as the successor in title to the property transferred, may pay out of the Fund Property any liability arising after the transfer which, had it arisen before the transfer, could properly have been paid out of the property transferred, but only if:

(a)

there is nothing in the Constitution of the Fund expressly forbidding the payment; and

(b)

the Fund Manager or the Trustee, as the case may be, is of the opinion that proper provision was made for meeting such liabilities as were known or could reasonably have been anticipated at the time of the transfer.
