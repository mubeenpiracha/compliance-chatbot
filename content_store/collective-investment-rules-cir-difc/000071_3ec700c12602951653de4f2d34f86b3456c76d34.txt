The type of investments referred to in Rule 3.1.13(b) include Warrants which confer rights to acquire unissued Shares or Units in an unlisted business venture. However, Warrants over unissued Debentures do not confer equity participation rights and are not included. Structured Products can also be used if the contractual rights confer on the Venture Capital Fund the right to participate in profits and assets of the business venture, in which the Fund invests.
