For the purposes of (2), where a Fund Manager makes arrangements with other Authorised Firms or Persons in other jurisdictions to Offer to issue or sell the Units of a Qualified Investor Fund, then it must take reasonable steps to ensure that those Authorised Firms or other Persons do not Offer to issue or sell the Units in a manner that would result in a breach of the conditions in Article 16(5) of the Law.

(4)

As soon as a Fund Manager becomes aware that a Qualified Investor Fund it manages no longer meets or is likely not to meet the conditions in Article 16(5) of the Law, it must immediately:

(a)

commence proceedings relating to the winding up of the Fund, or alternatively, take necessary steps to have the Fund reconstituted as an Exempt Fund or registered as a Public Fund; and

(b)

notify the DFSA of that fact and the measures it has taken and proposes to take under (a).
