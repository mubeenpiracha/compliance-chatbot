Guidance

1.

If the prime broker holds the legal title to the Fund assets, the prime broker must, in any event, qualify as an Eligible Custodian. However, even if a prime broker does not hold the legal title to the Fund assets, Rule 13.6.3(c) requires it to meet the Eligible Custodian requirements in certain circumstances. This is where it has the power to use Fund assets as collateral for its financing activities (e.g. by having a charge over the Fund assets) in conjunction with any other assets held by or available to it.

2.

In relation to the matters referred to in Rules 13.6.1 and 13.6.2 and in relation to management of Hedge Fund investments, the DFSA expects Fund Managers of Hedge Funds to have proper regard to best practice standards and guidance set out in App 8, DFSAâ€™s Hedge Fund Code of Practice as well as international developments relating to Hedge Funds.
