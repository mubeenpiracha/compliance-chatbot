When a Fund Manager manages Funds that are Incorporated Cells of an ICC, the Fund Manager is subject to the additional duties under chapter 6A (as well as the duties in this chapter). The Fund Manager will need to ensure that it meets all of its obligations relating to each Fund on the Fund Platform, even if some activities or functions of the Fund Manager are carried out by the Fund Platform.
