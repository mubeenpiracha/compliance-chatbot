Prospectus requirement for Public Funds

Guidance

The disclosure requirements relating to a Prospectus that apply to a Public Fund are somewhat more extensive than the Prospectus disclosure that apply to other types of Funds, in particular, Exempt Funds and Qualified Investor Funds. However, as Prospectus disclosure is a matter closely linked to the marketing of Funds, Prospectus requirements relating to the relevant types of Funds are set out in Part 7 of this module, which deals with the Offer of Units of Funds.
