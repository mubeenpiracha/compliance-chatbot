Actively managed ETF

16. An ETF is actively managed if the Fund Manager exercises discretion over the composition of the invested portfolio in an attempt to outperform a chosen index or other benchmark. The key difference, compared to an index tracking ETF, is a Fund Manager’s ability to adjust the portfolio without being subject to the set rules of the index or other benchmark referenced. An actively managed ETF could be a physical ETF or a synthetic ETF – with a portfolio selected at the discretion of the Fund Manager or derivatives designed at the discretion of the Fund Manager. The DFSA regime does not permit the creation of actively managed ETFs (see Rule 13.9.3) as there is less transparency relating to the underlying portfolio of assets. This gives rise to potential difficulties in clearly identifying risks associated with exposures to counterparties and any collateral used in such ETFs, compared to ETFs that passively track the performance of a specified index or other benchmark.
