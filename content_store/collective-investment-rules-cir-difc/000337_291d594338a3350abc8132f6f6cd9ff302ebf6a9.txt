ETF terminology

(Annual) tracking difference

2.

(Annual) tracking difference measures the actual performance of the ETF, compared to the annual return of the tracked index or other benchmark, generally over a 12 month period (but this could be over a shorter specified period).

Indicative Net Asset Value (iNAV)

3.

iNAV is a measure of the intraday value of the net asset value (NAV) of an index-based ETF, based on the most up-to-date information. iNAV is not the value at which investors buy and sell ETF Units through the Authorised Participant. iNAV is calculated and made available by the operator of the exchange on which an ETF is traded â€“ based on the information made available to the relevant exchange by the ETF manager and the AP relating to the underlying portfolio of ETF assets.

Exchange traded products (ETPs)

4.

ETPs include a wide variety of different investment products that are traded on an exchange, such as exchange-traded commodities (ETCs), exchange-traded notes (ETNs), exchange-traded instruments (ETIs), and exchange-traded vehicles (ETVs). Most of these are debt instruments, and not equity participation rights conferred by a Unit of an ETF.
