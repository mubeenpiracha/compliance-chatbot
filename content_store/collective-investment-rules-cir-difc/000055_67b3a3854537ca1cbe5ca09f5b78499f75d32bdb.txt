Guidance

A Fund of Funds does not cease to be a Fund of Funds merely because it holds some investments in cash or transferable securities to meet its on-going obligations such as for redemption purposes.

Feeder Fund

A Fund is a Feeder Fund if it is dedicated to investing in the Units or Debentures of a single other Fund (Master Fund).

Guidance

1.

A Domestic Feeder Fund may have as its Master Fund a Foreign Fund.

2.

A Sub-Fund of an Umbrella Fund is not a Feeder Fund.

Master Fund

A Fund is a Master Fund if it issues its Units or Debentures only to other Funds which are dedicated to investing in that Master Fund.
