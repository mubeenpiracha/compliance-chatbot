The circumstances in which a Fund Manager may withhold redemption proceeds under (3) include where there are any dues from the redeeming Unitholder, such as under any margin lending arrangements.

5.

See Article 37 of the Law for provisions dealing with suspension of dealings of Open- ended Funds.

6.

If an Open-ended Domestic Fund is listed and traded, the redemption and reissue of its Units in the primary market does not generally take place concurrently, unless it is an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). However, the exchange on which an Open-ended Fund is listed and traded may permit the Fund Manager to offer periodic windows for redemption and reissue of Units of the Fund (which would have to be based on NAV). The DFSA regime allows such windows, subject to disclosure in the Fundâ€™s Prospectus and to the relevant exchange as to when such windows would be offered.
