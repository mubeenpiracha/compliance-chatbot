Guidance

1.

For the purposes of (a), a Fund Manager’s procedures should take into account matters such as the market in which the trade is to be executed, the kind and size of the transaction concerned and type of services provided by the executing broker that has been selected. A Fund Manager’s procedures should be adequate to demonstrate that when the transaction was executed, it was done at the best price available. For this purpose, a Fund Manager may require a print out of a computer screen containing information about the price available at the time of the execution to be maintained.

2.

For the purposes of (b), a Fund Manager should have a policy in place which demonstrates how it achieves timely and fair allocation of trades. For example, where a Fund Manager places an order on behalf of a number of Funds it operates, its policy should state the basis of allocation of trades to each Fund and, where any deviation from that policy occurs, record the reasons for such deviations.
