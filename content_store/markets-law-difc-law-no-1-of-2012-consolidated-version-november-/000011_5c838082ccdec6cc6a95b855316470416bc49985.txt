CHAPTER 1: DEFINITIONS

38.

Definition of a Reporting Entity

(1)

A person is, subject to Article 38(3), a Reporting Entity if the person:

(a)

has or had Securities admitted to an Official List of Securities at any time;

(b)

has or had Security Tokens admitted to trading on an Alternative Trading System, where the Security Tokens were not admitted to an Official List of Securities or to trading on a Regulated Exchange;

(c)

has made an Offer of Securities to the Public other than in relation to Units of a Fund;

(d)

merges with or acquires a Reporting Entity referred to in Article 38(1)(a), (b) or (c); or

(e)

is declared by the DFSA pursuant to Article 38(4) to be a Reporting Entity.

(2)

For the purposes of Article 38(1)(a) and (b):

(a)

in the case of a Fund where the Units are or have been included in an Official List of Securities (a “Listed Fund”):

(i)

a reference to a Reporting Entity is a reference to the Fund Manager of that Fund or such other person as the DFSA may declare (who may also be called a “Reporting Entity of the Listed Fund”); and

(ii)

any obligations of a Reporting Entity are, unless the context requires otherwise, obligations in respect of the Listed Fund; and

(b)

for avoidance of doubt, a person does not become a Reporting Entity of a Listed Fund by merely offering the Units of the Fund to the public, unless the Units are also admitted to an Authorised Market Institution.

(c)

in the case of a Fund, other than a Listed Fund, where the Units are Security Tokens admitted to trading on an Alternative Trading System:

(i)

a reference to a Reporting Entity is a reference to the Fund Manager of that Fund or such other person as the DFSA may declare; and
