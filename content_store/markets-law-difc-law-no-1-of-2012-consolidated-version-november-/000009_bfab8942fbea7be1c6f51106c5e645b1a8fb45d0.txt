33. Admission of Securities to an Official List of Securities

(1)

An Authorised Market Institution or the DFSA may grant admission of Securities to an Official List of Securities maintained by it only where it is satisfied that such admission is in accordance with the requirements in this Law and the Rules made for the purposes of that Law.

(2) Where a person applies to have Securities admitted to an Official List of Securities maintained by an Authorised Market Institution or the DFSA, the Authorised Market Institution or the DFSA, as is relevant, shall notify the applicant in writing of its decision in relation to the application for admission of Securities to the Official List of Securities.

(3) Where a person has any Securities included in an Official List of Securities, such Securities shall be admitted to trading on an Authorised Market Institution as soon as possible.

(4) Where any Securities included in an Official List of Securities are not admitted to trading in accordance with the requirement in Article 33(3), such Securities shall be removed from the Official List of Securities.

(5)

A person shall not have any Securities admitted to an Official List of Securities unless those Securities are also admitted to trading on an Authorised Market Institution.

(6)

The DFSA may, by Rules, prescribe any circumstances in which Securities admitted to an Official List of Securities need not comply with the requirement in Article 33(3).

34. Objections or refusal by the DFSA to an admission of Securities to an Official List of

Securities

(1) Where an Authorised Market Institution maintains an Official List of Securities,

the DFSA may:

(a)

object to the admission of Securities to such an Official List of Securities; or

(b)

impose conditions or restrictions in respect of the admission of Securities to such an Official List of Securities, or vary or withdraw such conditions or restrictions,

in the circumstances specified in Article 34(3).

refuse an application for admission of Securities to such an Official List of Securities; or

16

(b)

impose conditions or restrictions, in respect of the admission of Securities to such an Official List of Securities, or vary or withdraw such conditions or restrictions,

in the circumstances specified in Article 34(3).

(a)

the DFSA reasonably considers, for a reason relating to the issuer of the Securities or to the Securities, that:

granting the Securities admission to an Official List of Securities would be detrimental to the interests of persons dealing in the relevant Securities using the facilities of an Authorised Market Institution or otherwise;

(ii)

any requirements in the listing rules as are applicable have not been or will not be complied with;

(iii)

any requirement imposed by the DFSA has not been or will not be complied with; or
