Guidance

1.

In determining whether an Authorised Market Institution can effectively monitor its Business Rules, the DFSA will consider:

a.

the oversight of activity conducted on its facilities;

b.

the range of powers it retains over Members and other Persons granted access to its facilities, which should include the ability to modify, revoke or suspend access; and

c.

the disciplinary procedures which have been established to take disciplinary action, including a fair and clear policy on any financial penalties which may be imposed, and the appeal processes.

2.

In determining whether an Authorised Market Institution can effectively oversee the activities conducted on its facilities, the DFSA will consider how non-compliance is identified and how the significance of any non-compliance is assessed.
