An Authorised Market Institution must, subject to (3), notify the DFSA in writing of any event specified in (1) as soon as possible after becoming aware of that event.

An Authorised Market Institution need not comply with the requirement in (2) if it is satisfied on reasonable grounds that a proposed or existing Controller has either already obtained the prior approval of the DFSA or notified the event to the DFSA as applicable.
