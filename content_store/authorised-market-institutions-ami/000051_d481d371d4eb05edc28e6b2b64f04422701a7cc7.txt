the point after which unsettled payments, transfer instructions, or other obligations may not be revoked by the parties to the underlying contract.

(3)

For the purposes of this Rule:

(a)

“final settlement” is the irrevocable and unconditional transfer of an asset or financial instrument, or the discharge of obligations arising under the underlying contract by the parties to the contract; and

(b)

“value date” is the day on which the payment, transfer instruction, or other obligation arising under the underlying contract is due and, accordingly, the associated funds or Investments are available to the respective parties under the contract.

Guidance

1.

Final settlement is usually dependent on the legal environment of where the settlement occurs. Generally, in the case of certain assets, final settlement includes the transfer of title.

2.

Completing final settlement by the end of the value date is important because deferring final settlement to the next-business day can create both credit and liquidity pressures for a Clearing House’s Members and other participants on its facilities and stakeholders. This may also be a potential source of systemic risk. Therefore, where possible, a Clearing House should provide intra-day or real-time settlement finality to reduce settlement risk.

AUTHORISED MARKET INSTITUTIONS (AMI)

Additional requirements for a CCP

Credit Risk

(1)

A Clearing House acting as a CCP must establish and implement a robust process to manage:

(a)

its current and potential future credit and market risk exposures to market counterparties, including Members and other participants on its facilities; and

(b)

credit risks arising from its payment, clearing, and settlement processes.

(2)

For the purposes of (1), a CCP must, on a regular basis as appropriate to the nature, scale and complexity of its operations:

(a)

perform stress tests using models containing standards and predetermined parameters and assumptions; and

(b)

carry out comprehensive and thorough analysis of stress testing models, scenarios, and underlying parameters and assumptions used to ensure that they are appropriate for determining the required level of default protection in light of current and evolving market conditions.

(3)

A CCP must:

(a)

undertake the analysis referred to in (2)(b) at least on a two-month basis, unless more frequent analysis is warranted because the Investments or Crypto Tokens cleared or markets served display the size or high volatility, become concentration of positions held by its participants increase significantly; and

less

liquid, or when

(b)

perform a full validation of its risk-management models at least annually.

Guidance

1.

A robust assessment process should enable a CCP to effectively measure, monitor, and manage its risks and exposures effectively. In particular, it should be able to identify sources of credit risk and routinely measure and monitor its credit exposures. Generally, a CCP should have daily stress testing to measure and monitor its risk exposures, especially if its operations are complex or widely spread over multiple jurisdictions. It should use appropriate risk management tools to control the identified credit risks. A CCP should use margin and other prefunded financial resources in order to do so.

2.

In particular, a CCP should establish explicit rules and procedures that address fully any credit losses it may face as a result of any individual or combined default among its Members and other participants with respect to any of their obligations to the CCP. Such rules and procedures should address how any potentially uncovered credit losses would be allocated, including the repayment of any funds the CCP may borrow from its liquidity providers. They should also indicate the CCP’s process to replenish any financial resources that it may employ during a stress event, so that it can continue to operate in a safe and sound manner.

AUTHORISED MARKET INSTITUTIONS (AMI)

3.

A CCP should document its supporting rationale for, and should have appropriate governance arrangements relating to, the amount of total financial resources it maintains. It should also have clear procedures to report the results of its stress tests to its Governing Body and senior management as appropriate, and use those results to evaluate the adequacy of its total financial resources and make any adjustments as appropriate.

Margin requirements

(1) Without limiting the generality of Rule 7.3.1, a Clearing House operating as a CCP must, for the purposes of managing its credit and market risk:
