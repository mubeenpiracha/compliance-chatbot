 of the Authorised Market Institution or a Holding Company of that institution. Similarly, a Person may be able to exert significant management influence where such Person does not hold shares or voting rights but has exercisable rights to acquire shares or voting rights, such as under Options.

Disregarded holdings

For the purposes of determining whether a Person is a Controller, shares, voting rights or rights to acquire shares or voting rights that a Person holds, either alone or with an Associate, in an Authorised Market Institution or a Holding Company of that institution are disregarded if:

(a)

the shares are held for the sole purpose of clearing and settling within a short settlement cycle;

(b)

the shares are held in a custodial or nominee capacity and the voting rights attached to the shares are exercised only in accordance with written instructions given to that Person by another Person; or

(c)

the Person is an Authorised Firm or a Regulated Financial Institution and it:

(i)

acquires a holding of shares as a result of an underwriting of a share issue or a placement of shares on a firm commitment basis;

(ii)

does not exercise the voting rights attaching to the shares or otherwise intervene in the management of the issuer; and

(iii)

retains the holding for a period less than one year.

8.2.3

AUTHORISED MARKET INSTITUTIONS (AMI)

unless that Person has obtained the prior written approval of the DFSA to do so.

(2)

For the purposes of (1)(b), the thresholds at which the prior written approval of the DFSA is required are when the relevant holding is increased:

(a)

from below 30% to 30% or more; or

(b)

from below 50% to 50% or more.

Guidance

See Rule 8.1.2 for the circumstances in which a Person becomes a Controller of an Authorised Market Institution.

Approval process

(1)

A Person who is required to obtain the prior written approval of the DFSA pursuant to Rule 8.2.1(1) must make an application to the DFSA using the appropriate form in AFN.

(2) Where the DFSA receives an application under (1), it may:

(a)

approve the proposed acquisition or increase in the level of control;

(b)

approve the proposed acquisition or increase in the level of control subject to such conditions as it considers appropriate; or

(c)

object to the proposed acquisition or increase in the level of control.

Guidance

1.

A Person intending to acquire or increase control in an Authorised Market Institution should submit an application for approval in the appropriate form in AFN sufficiently in advance of the proposed acquisition to be able to obtain the DFSA approval in time for the proposed acquisition.

2.

Paragraph 3.6.7 of the RPP Sourcebook sets out the matters which the DFSA takes into consideration when exercising its powers under Rule 8.2.2 to approve, object to or impose conditions of approval relating to a proposed Controller or an increase in the level of control of an existing Controller.

(1) Where the DFSA proposes to approve a proposed acquisition of or an increase in the level of control in an Authorised Market Institution pursuant to Rule 8.2.2(2)(a), it must:

(a)

do so as soon as practicable and in any event within 90 days of the receipt of a duly completed application, unless a different period is considered appropriate by the DFSA and notified to the applicant in writing; and

(b)

issue to the applicant, and where appropriate to the Authorised Market Institution, an approval notice as soon as practicable after making that decision.
