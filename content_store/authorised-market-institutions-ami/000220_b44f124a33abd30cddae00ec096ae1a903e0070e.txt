Guidance

1.

An Exchange is required, as part of information to be provided to the DFSA, to promptly inform the DFSA where breaches of the ownership restrictions occur. See section 9.8.

2.

An Exchange should establish appropriate thresholds at which an early warning system and subsequent public disclosure is triggered relating to foreign ownership restrictions. Such thresholds should be set at intervals/levels, taking into account the patterns of trading in the relevant Investments and other factors which enable the Exchange to take preventative measures before the breaches occur.
