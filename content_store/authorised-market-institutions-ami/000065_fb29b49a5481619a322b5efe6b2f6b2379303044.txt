Guidance

1.

The DFSA will need to be satisfied when considering requests under Rule 10.2.1, that an Authorised Market Institution has made appropriate arrangements with respect to its existing users (including the receipt of consent where required) and, in particular:

a.

whether there may be a long period in which the business will be wound down or transferred;

b.

whether money and other assets belonging to users must be returned to them; and

c.

whether there is any other matter which the DFSA would reasonably expect to be resolved before granting a request for the withdrawal of a Licence.

2.

In determining a request for the withdrawal of a Licence, the DFSA may require additional procedures or information as appropriate including evidence that the Authorised Market Institution has ceased to carry on Financial Services.

AUTHORISED MARKET INSTITUTIONS (AMI)

3.

Detailed plans should be submitted where there may be an extensive period of wind- down. It may not be appropriate for an Authorised Market Institution to immediately request a withdrawal of its Licence in all circumstances, although it may wish to consider reducing the scope of its Licence during this period. Authorised Market Institutions should discuss these arrangements with the DFSA.

4.

The DFSA may refuse a request for the withdrawal of a Licence where it appears that users and customers may be adversely affected.

5.

The DFSA may also refuse a request for the withdrawal of a Licence where:

a.

the Authorised Market Institution has failed to settle its debts to the DFSA; or

b.

it is in the interests of a current or pending investigation by the DFSA, or by another regulatory body or Financial Services Regulator.

6.

Under Article 63 where the DFSA grants a request for the withdrawal of a Licence, the DFSA may continue to exercise any power under the Regulatory Law, the Markets Law or Rules in relation to an Authorised Market Institution for a period of three years from the date on
