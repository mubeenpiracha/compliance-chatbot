(2)

Before an Authorised Market Institution assigns to a Key Individual any commercial functions, the Authorised Market Institution must:

(a)

form a view on a reasonable basis that the commercial functions to be assigned to any Key Individual do not, as far as reasonably practicable, conflict with the relevant Key Individual functions or impair his ability to discharge those functions effectively; and

(b)

to the extent there are such conflicts inherent in the relevant functions, there are adequate procedures and controls to mitigate such conflicts.
