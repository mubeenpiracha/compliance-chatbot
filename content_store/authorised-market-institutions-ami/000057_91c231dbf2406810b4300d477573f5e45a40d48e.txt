Guidance

1.

See section 2.3 of the RPP sourcebook for details of the assessment that the Authorised Market Institution and the DFSA undertake to assess whether an individual is fit and proper to undertake Key Individual functions.

2.

An Authorised Market Institution may apply for the DFSAâ€™s in-principle approval of an individual as soon as the individual is identified as a potential appointee to avoid any delays in formalising the appointment. However, an Authorised Market Institution should submit to the DFSA, as far as reasonably practicable, all the relevant information, including the results of its own assessment, when seeking such in-principle approval.
