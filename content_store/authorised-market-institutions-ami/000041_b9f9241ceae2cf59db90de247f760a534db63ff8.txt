Short selling and position management

(1)

An Exchange must have in place effective systems, controls and procedures to monitor and manage:

(a)

Short Selling in Securities; and

(b)

risks arising from position concentrations.

(2)

For the purposes of (1), an Exchange must have adequate powers over its Members to address risks to an orderly functioning of its facilities arising from unsettled positions in Investments.

(3)

Short Selling for the purposes of this Rule constitutes the sale of a Security by a Person who does not own the Security at the point of entering into the contract to sell.

Guidance

1.

An Exchange should, when developing its controls and procedures with regard to Short Selling and position management, have regard to:

a.

its own settlement cycle, in order to ensure that any Short Selling activities on its facilities do not result in any delay or prevent effective settlement within such cycle; and

b.

orderly functioning of its facilities, to ensure that any long or short position concentration on Investments that remain unsettled does not interrupt such functioning.
