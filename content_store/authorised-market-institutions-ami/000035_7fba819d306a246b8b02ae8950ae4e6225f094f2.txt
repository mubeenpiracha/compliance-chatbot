1.

The Licensing Requirements are specified in chapters 5, 5A, 5B, 6 and 7 of Part 3 of this module. These include the general requirements applicable to all Authorised Market Institutions (chapter 5), and the additional requirements applicable to specific types of activities of Authorised Market Institutions (chapters 5A, 5B, 6 and 7).

Where an Authorised Market Institution (or an applicant for a Licence) seeks to obtain an endorsement on its Licence, additional requirements relevant to the type of endorsement need to be satisfied (see, for example, App 5 of GEN for the requirements relating to Trade Repositories).

Currently, the function of maintaining an Official List of Securities is performed by the DFSA. However, the DFSA has the power, pursuant to Article 29 of the Markets Law, to grant an Authorised Market Institution an endorsement on its Licence permitting it to maintain an Official List of Securities.

Section 3.6 of the RPP Sourcebook sets out the matters which the DFSA takes into consideration when making an assessment under Rule 3.2.1.
