Guidance

In determining whether an Exchange can effectively monitor its listing rules, the DFSA will consider amongst other things:

a.

the oversight of the Official List of Securities;

b.

the range of powers the Exchange retains over Persons with Securities admitted to its Official List of Securities which should include the ability to suspend, restore from suspension and de-list Securities from the Official List of Securities in accordance with this module; and

c.

the disciplinary procedures which have been established to take disciplinary action, including a fair and clear policy on any financial penalties which may be imposed, and the appeal processes.
