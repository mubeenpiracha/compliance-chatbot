Section 3.6 of the RPP Sourcebook sets out the matters which the DFSA takes into consideration when making an assessment under Rule 3.2.1.

Inquiries and information

In assessing an application for a Licence or an endorsement on a Licence, the DFSA may:

(a)

make any enquiries which it considers appropriate, including enquiries independent of the applicant;

(b)

require the applicant to provide additional information;

(c)

require the applicant to have information on how it intends to ensure compliance with a particular requirement;

(d)

require any information provided by the applicant to be verified in any way that the DFSA specifies; and

(e)

take into account any information which it considers relevant.

(1)

In assessing an application for a Licence, the DFSA may, by means of written notice, indicate the legal form that the applicant may adopt to enable authorisation to be granted.

(2) Where the DFSA thinks it appropriate, it may treat an application made by one legal form or Person as having been made by the new legal form or Person.

Obtaining Key Individual status

Guidance

Under Article 43 of the Regulatory Law, every Authorised Market Institution must have Key Individuals appointed to perform Licensed Functions. Key Individuals appointed by an Authorised Market Institution to perform Licensed Functions must be approved by the DFSA before they are permitted to carry on such functions. This section sets out the matters that will be considered by the DFSA in approving such Key Individuals. The list of Licensed Functions for an Authorised Market Institution is in section 5.3 of this module.
