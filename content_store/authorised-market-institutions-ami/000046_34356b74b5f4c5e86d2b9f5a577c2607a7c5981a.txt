Risk management

Guidance

1.

An Authorised Market Institution which operates a Clearing House is subject to the management, systems and controls requirements in GEN chapter 5. These provisions require such an Authorised Market Institution to establish and maintain risk management

73

AMI/VER28/03-25

7.2.1.

7.2.2

AUTHORISED MARKET INSTITUTIONS (AMI)

systems and controls to enable it to identify, assess, mitigate, control and monitor the risks to which it is exposed and to develop and implement policies and procedures to manage the risks to which it and the users of its facilities are exposed.

2.

The requirements set out below augment the GEN obligations referred to in 1.

Risk management framework

(1)

A Clearing House must have a comprehensive risk management framework (i.e. detailed policies, procedures and systems) capable of managing legal, credit, liquidity, operational and other risks to which it is exposed.

(2)

The risk management framework in (1) must:

(a)

encompass a regular review of material risks to which the Clearing House is exposed and the risks posed to other market participants resulting from its operations; and

(b)

be subject to periodic review as appropriate to ensure that it is effective and operating as intended.

Guidance

1.

The risk management framework should, for the purposes of Rule 7.2.1(2)(a), identify scenarios that may potentially prevent a Clearing House from being able to provide its critical operations and services as a going concern and assess the effectiveness of a full range of options for recovery or orderly wind-down.

2.

A Clearing House should prepare appropriate plans for resumption of its operations in such scenarios and, where it is not possible to do so, for an orderly wind-down of the operations of the Clearing House premised on the results of such assessments.

3.

Such procedures should also include appropriate early notification to the DFSA and other regulators as appropriate. See also the requirements in section 9.8 relating to disclosure to the DFSA.

4.

A Clearing House should also, to the extent possible, provide incentives to Members and other market participants to manage and contain the risks they pose to the orderly and efficient operations of the Clearing House. Those may include financial penalties to Members and other participants that fail to settle Investments or Crypto Tokens in a timely manner or to repay intraday credit by the end of the operating day.

Legal risk

(1)

A Clearing House must have a well-founded, clear, transparent, and enforceable legal basis for each material aspect of its activities in all relevant jurisdictions.

(2)

A Clearing House must have adequate rules and procedures, including contractual arrangements, which are legally enforceable.

(3)

A Clearing House that operates in multiple jurisdictions must:

(a)

identify and mitigate the risks arising from doing business in the relevant jurisdictions, including those arising from conflicting laws applicable in such jurisdictions; and

74

AMI/VER28/03-25

7.2.3

AUTHORISED MARKET INSTITUTIONS (AMI)

(b)

ensure the arrangements referred to in (2) provide a high degree of certainty that actions taken by the Clearing House under its rules and procedures will not be reversed, stayed or rendered void.

Guidance

1.

This Rule is designed to address legal risks faced by a Clearing House, particularly where it operates in multiple jurisdictions. For example, an unexpected application of a law or regulation may render a contract between itself and a counterparty void or unenforceable, thereby leading to a loss.

2.

A Clearing House should be able to demonstrate to the DFSA that the legal basis on which it operates, including in multiple jurisdictions, is well founded. A well founded legal basis would generally include well defined rights and obligations of the Clearing House, its Members and other users, including its service providers such as custodians and settlement banks, or would provide a mechanism by which such rights and obligations can be ascertained. This would enable the Clearing House to identify and address risks that arise from its operations involving such parties.

3.

A Clearing House should, in order to form clear views about the legally binding nature of its contractual arrangements in the relevant jurisdictions, obtain independent legal opinions as appropriate to its activities
