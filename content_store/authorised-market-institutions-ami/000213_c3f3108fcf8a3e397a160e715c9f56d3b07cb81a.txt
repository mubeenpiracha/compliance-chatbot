Guidance

When assessing whether an Exchange has an appropriate and adequate Error Trade policy, the DFSA will consider whether the rules and procedures included in the Business Rules:

a.

are adequate and, where prevention is not possible, minimise the impact of Error Trades;

b.

are sufficiently flexible in the design to address varying scenarios;

c.

establish a predictable and timely process for dealing with Error Trades, including measures specifically designed to detect and identify Error Trade messages to market users;
