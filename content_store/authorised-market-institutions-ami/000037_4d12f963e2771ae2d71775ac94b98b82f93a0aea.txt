Guidance

1.

When assessing whether an Exchangeâ€™s rules and procedures are adequate, the DFSA will consider, among other things:

a.

the criteria adopted by the Exchange for Derivative contracts to be traded on its facilities;

b.

what powers the Exchange has in order to eliminate manipulative or disorderly conduct, including powers to vary, remove or rescind conditions of any Derivative contracts already traded where these are found to cause manipulative or disorderly conditions; and

c.

what mechanisms are established by the Exchange to monitor and review market activities relating to Derivative contracts traded on its facilities.

2.

When designing and reviewing the design of Commodity Derivative contracts, an Exchange should consider the following physical market characteristics, including differences within a commodity market with regard to the commodity in question:

a.

size and structure of the physical market;

b.

commodity characteristics (such as grade, quality, weight, class, growth, origin, source etc.);
