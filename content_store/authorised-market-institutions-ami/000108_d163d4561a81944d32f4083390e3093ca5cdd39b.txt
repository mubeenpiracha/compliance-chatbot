Guidance

1.

The DFSA does not formally approve the proposed amendments at the point of release of the proposed amendment for public consultation; instead that approval occurs at the end of the public consultation period because the DFSA can properly take into account any public comments and changes resulting from public comments only at the end of the public consultation period.

2.

However, the DFSA may, upon receipt of the proposed amendment, request an extension of the public consultation period if it considers on reasonable grounds that such an extension is appropriate. The circumstances in which the DFSA may require an extended period of public consultation beyond 30 days include where the proposed amendment is likely to have a significant adverse impact on the Membersâ€™ rights and obligations or the interests of other participants in the DIFC markets. An Authorised Market Institution may rely on the results of soft consultation with Members and other stakeholders, or with any user committees it has established, to demonstrate that the proposed amendment does not warrant public consultation.
