 elsewhere; and

communicating information about Market Abuse and financial crime to the DFSA or appropriate regulatory authorities.

(1)

An Authorised Market Institution must:

(a)

(2)

An Authorised Market Institution must promptly notify the DFSA of any:

(a)

material breach of its regime by a Member; and

(b)

circumstances in which a Member will not or cannot rectify a breach of its regime.

Guidance

1.

An Authorised Market Institution is subject to the requirements in the DFSA’s AML module. Members of an Authorised Market Institution which are Authorised Firms are also subject, by virtue of being Authorised Firms, to the requirements in the DFSA’s AML module.

2.

In determining whether an Authorised Market Institution’s measures are adequate and appropriate to reduce the extent to which its facilities can be used for Market Abuse, money laundering and financial crime, the DFSA will consider:

a.

whether the Authorised Market Institution has appropriate staff, surveillance systems, resources and procedures for this purpose;

b.

the monitoring conducted for possible patterns of normal, abnormal or improper use of those facilities;

c.

how promptly and accurately information is communicated about Market Abuse, financial crime and money laundering to the DFSA and other appropriate organisations; and

d.

how the Authorised Market Institution co-operates with relevant bodies in the prevention, investigation and pursuit of Market Abuse, money laundering and financial crime.

3.

An Authorised Market Institution shall have regard to Part 6 of the Markets Law in relation to Market Abuse and the relevant provisions of the Regulatory Law. Examples of practices that amount to market manipulation (which is one form of Market Abuse) in an automated trading environment that should be identified and prevented by an Authorised Market Institution to promote Proper Markets include the following:

a.

entering small orders in order to ascertain the level of hidden orders, particularly used to assess what is resting on a dark platform, known as Ping Orders;

b.

entering large numbers of orders and/or cancellations/updates to orders to create uncertainty for other market participants, slowing down their process and to camouflage its own strategy, known as Quote Stuffing;

c.

entry of orders or a series of orders intended to start or exacerbate a trend, and to encourage other participants to accelerate or extend the trend in order to create an opportunity to unwind/open a position at a favourable price, known as Moment Ignition; and

d.

submitting multiple orders often away from one side of the order book with the intention of executing a trade on the other side of the order book, where once that trade has taken place, the manipulative orders will be removed, known as Layering and Spoofing.
