where Mi is the remaining maturity of the transaction, floored at ten business days.

Guidance

The formula requires that the minimum time risk horizon for unmargined transactions is the lesser of one year and the remaining maturity of the derivative contract, floored at ten business days.

Time risk horizons – margined transactions

A4.6.33 The Authorised Person must calculate the MFi of margined transactions in accordance

with the following formula:

The appropriate margin period of risk (MPORi) is determined in accordance with the following table:

Transaction Type

Minimum Margin Period of Risk (MPORi)

Non-centrally-cleared derivative transactions subject to daily margin agreements

Ten business days

Centrally cleared derivative transactions subject to daily margin agreements

Five business days

Netting sets consisting of 5,000 or more transactions that are not with a central counterparty

Twenty business days

Netting sets with outstanding disputes

Double the MPORi for the relevant category of transaction

Supervisory factors, correlation and supervisory option volatilities

A4.6.34 Supervisory factors are specific to each asset class. The Authorised Person must refer to the table below to determine the supervisory factor relevant to their determination of the add-on for their particular asset class in accordance with the asset-class- specific formulae set out in Rules A4.6.35 to A4.6.58.

Trade level adjusted notional – interest rate (di

(IR)) and credit derivatives (di

(Credit))

A4.6.35 For interest rate and credit derivatives, the trade-level adjusted notional is the product of the trade notional amount, converted to the domestic currency, and the supervisory duration (SDi):

Trade-level adjusted notional = Trade notional amount * SDi

PRU VER17.290725

A4.6.36 SDi is determined in accordance with the following formula:

𝑆𝐷𝑖 =

exp(-0.05∗𝑆𝑖) − exp(-0.05∗𝐸𝑖) 0.05

where Si and Ei are the start and end dates, respectively, of the time period referenced by the interest rate or credit derivative, floored by ten business days.
