Guidance

1.

Offsetting is not permitted since differences in coupon rates, liquidity, and call features, for example, signify that prices may diverge in the short run.

2.

The "Other" category will receive the same Specific Risk requirement as a private-sector borrower under the CRCOM, 8%. However, since this may, in certain cases, considerably underestimate the Specific Risk for debt Securities which have a high yield to redemption relative to government debt Securities, the Regulator has the right to apply to such Securities a Specific Risk percentage higher than 8%.
