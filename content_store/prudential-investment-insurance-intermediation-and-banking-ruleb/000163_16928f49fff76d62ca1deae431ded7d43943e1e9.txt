 must determine the add-on for each asset class in accordance

with the asset-class-specific formulae set out in A4.6.35 – A4.6.58.

Guidance

Most derivative transactions have one primary risk driver, defined by the reference underlying instrument (e.g. an interest rate curve for an interest rate swap, a reference entity for a credit default swap, a foreign exchange rate for an FX call option etc.).

Formulae and parameters common to all asset classes

A4.6.30 The following formulae and adjustments are used in the determination of the add-ons

for all asset classes.

Supervisory delta adjustment: δi

A4.6.31 The Authorised Person must include the following supervisory delta adjustments in

the calculation of the relevant add-on where relevant.

δi

Long in the primary risk factor

Short in the primary risk factor

With the following parameters:

Pi = underlying price (spot, forward, average etc.)

Ki = strike price

Ti = latest contractual exercise date of the option

The supervisory volatility σi of an option is specified on the basis of the supervisory factor applicable to the trade in accordance with the table set out in A4.6.34.

With the following parameters:

Ai = attachment point of the CDO tranche

Di = detachment point of the CDO tranche

Guidance

"Long in the primary risk factor" means that the market value of the instrument increases, whereas "short in the primary risk factor" means that the market value of the instrument decreases when the value of the primary risk factor increases. The symbol Φ in these equations represents the standard normal cumulative distribution function.

Time risk horizons – unmargined transactions

A4.6.32 The Authorised Person must calculate the maturity factor (MFi) of unmargined

transactions in accordance with the following formula:

𝑀𝐹𝑖

(𝑢𝑛𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑑) = √

min (𝑀𝑖;1 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟) 1 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟

PRU VER17.290725

where Mi is the remaining maturity of the transaction, floored at ten business days.

Guidance

The formula requires that the minimum time risk horizon for unmargined transactions is the lesser of one year and the remaining maturity of
