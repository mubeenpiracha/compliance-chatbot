Trade Exposure of a client to a clearing member

A4.9.7 Where an Authorised Person is a client of a clearing member, and enters into a transaction with the clearing member acting as an intermediary between the Authorised Person and a CCP, it must calculate Credit RWA in respect of its Trade Exposure to the clearing member as if it were a Trade Exposure to a QCCP provided all the conditions in Rule A4.9.8 are satisfied.

A4.9.8
