Guidance

Guidance on the characteristics of “operational” Deposits is given under Rule A10.2.15.

A10.4.17 For encumbered assets not captured in the table in Rule A10.4.16, an Authorised Person must assign an RSF factor for Required Stable Funding in accordance with the following.

(a)

Assets encumbered for a period of between six months and less than one year that would, if unencumbered, receive an RSF factor lower than or equal to 50% must receive an RSF factor of 50%.

(b) Assets encumbered for between six months and less than one year that would, if unencumbered, receive an RSF factor higher than 50% retain that higher RSF factor.

(c) Where assets have less than six months remaining in the encumbrance period, those assets may receive the same RSF factor as an equivalent asset that is unencumbered.

(d)

For the purposes of calculating the NSFR, assets that are encumbered for exceptional central bank liquidity operations must receive the RSF factor that they would if they were unencumbered.

the assets to which Rule A10.4.17 applies by:
