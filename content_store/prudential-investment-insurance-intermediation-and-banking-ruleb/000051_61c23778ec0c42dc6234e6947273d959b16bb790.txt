The weighted average of the Countercyclical Capital Buffer rates shall be calculated by:

(a)

for each jurisdiction in which the Authorised Person has private sector credit exposures, dividing the Total Risk Exposure Amount that relates to the private sector credit exposures in that jurisdiction by the Total Risk Exposure Amount that relates to the Authorised Person's private sector credit exposures across all jurisdictions and multiplying it by the applicable Countercyclical Capital Buffer rate in that jurisdiction; and

(b)

summing those contributions across all jurisdictions.

Geographical location

3.18.7

For the purposes of the calculation of the weighted average of the applicable Countercyclical Capital Buffer rates an Authorised Person must identify, to the best of its ability, the geographical location of its private sector credit exposures as the jurisdiction where the underlying credit risk ultimately originates.

Countercyclical Capital Buffer rates

3.18.8

(1)

For a private sector credit exposure located in ADGM or the UAE:

(a)

the Countercyclical Capital Buffer rate is the rate set by the Central Bank from time to time, subject to a maximum rate of 2.5%; and

(b) any increase in the Countercyclical Capital Buffer rate specified by the Central Bank takes effect from the date specified by the Central Bank.

(2)

For a private sector credit exposure located in a third country:

(a) the Countercyclical Capital Buffer rate is:

(i)

the rate set by the authority responsible for setting the Countercyclical Capital Buffer rate in that third country from time to time; or

94

PRU VER17.290725

(ii)

2.5% where the rate set by the third country rate setting authority exceeds 2.5%; or

(iii)

the rate set by the Central Bank where it sets a rate for a private sector credit exposure in the third country that exceeds that set by the third-country rate-setting authority, up to a maximum of 2.5%; or

(iv)

zero where the third country rate setting authority has not set a Countercyclical Capital Buffer rate for that jurisdiction and the Central Bank does not specify such a rate; and

(b) any increase in the applicable Countercyclical Capital Buffer rate shall take effect from the date specified by the third country rate setting authority or the Central Bank, as appropriate;

(3)

Subject to (2)(a)(ii) and (iii) above for a private sector credit exposure in a third country, where a Countercyclical Capital Buffer rate for a jurisdiction is reduced that reduction shall take effect immediately.

Guidance

An example of the calculation of the Countercyclical Capital Buffer follows, for an Authorised Person with private sector credit exposures in countries A, B and C of 60, 25 and 15 respectively, and where the applicable Countercyclical Capital Buffer rates are 2.0%, 1.0% and 1.5% respectively.

Combined Buffer

3.19.1

The Combined Buffer is the sum of the Capital Conservation Buffer and the Countercyclical Capital Buffer.

An Authorised Person must not use CET1 Capital that is held to meet the Combined Buffer Requirement to meet:

(a)

its Capital Requirement;

(b)

any Individual Capital Requirement that may be imposed pursuant to Chapter 10; or

(c)

any other buffer, where applicable.

Guidance

Where an Authorised Person does not hold sufficient dedicated CET1 Capital to meet the Combined Buffer Requirement it will be required to undertake remed
