An Authorised Person is in Category 2 if:

(a)

its Financial Services Permission authorises it to carry on one or both of the Regulated Activities of Providing Credit or Dealing in Investments as Principal (not as Matched Principal);

(b)

its dealing activities are not limited in scope as provided in Rule 1.3.3(1)(a)(i); and

(c)

it does not meet the criteria of Categories 1 or 5.

Category 3A

Guidance

A Category 3A Authorised Person may be authorised to conduct other Regulated Activities, but it is the authorisation for Dealing in Investments as Agent and the absence of authorisation for the activities specified in Rules 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 that are determinative of its belonging to Category 3A. Provided that an Authorised Person carries out the Regulated Activity of Dealing in Investments as Agent in a manner that is wholly incidental to the activity of Managing an Investment Fund or Managing Assets, the Authorised Person shall be regarded as falling within Category 3C.
