Where an Authorised Person hedges a Non-Trading Book Exposure using a Credit Derivative booked in the Trading Book, the Non-Trading Book Exposure is not deemed to be hedged for the purpose of calculating its regulatory Capital Requirement, unless the Authorised Person purchases from an eligible protection provider a Credit Derivative which complies with the requirements and meets the guidelines set out in the relevant Section of Chapter 4. Where eligible credit protection is purchased and is recognised as a hedge of the Non-Trading Book Exposure for the purpose of calculating its regulatory Capital Requirement, the Authorised Person may exclude both the internal and external Credit Derivative hedge from the Trading Book for the purpose of calculating its regulatory Capital Requirement for the period of the hedge.
