Category 3B

1.3.4

An Authorised Person is in Category 3B if:

(a)

its Financial Services Permission authorises it to carry on one or more of the Regulated Activities of:

(i) Providing Custody (where it does so for a Fund); or

(ii) Acting as the Trustee of an Investment Trust; and

(b)

it does not meet the criteria of Categories 1, 2, 3A or 5.

Guidance

A Category 3B Authorised Person may be authorised to conduct other Regulated Activities, but it is the authorisation for Providing Custody for a Fund or Acting as Trustee of a Fund, and the absence of authorisation for the activities specified in Rules 1.3.1, 1.3.2 and 1.3.3 that are determinative of its belonging to Category 3B.
