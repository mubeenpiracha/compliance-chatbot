3.19.2

An Authorised Person must not use CET1 Capital that is held to meet the Combined Buffer Requirement to meet:

(a)

its Capital Requirement;

(b)

any Individual Capital Requirement that may be imposed pursuant to Chapter 10; or

(c)

any other buffer, where applicable.

Guidance

Where an Authorised Person does not hold sufficient dedicated CET1 Capital to meet the Combined Buffer Requirement it will be required to undertake remedial action in order to restore the level of CET1 Capital to the required level.

Restrictions on distributions

3.19.3 Where an Authorised Person fails to meet the Combined Buffer Requirement, it must:

(a)

calculate the maximum distributable amount in accordance with Rule 3.19.6; and

(b)

ensure that it does not undertake any of the following actions until such time as it has calculated the maximum distributable amount and notified the Regulator under Rule 3.19.7:

(i)

make a distribution in connection with CET1 Capital, or create an obligation to pay variable remuneration or discretionary pension benefits, or pay variable remuneration if the obligation to pay was created at a time when the institution failed to meet its Combined Buffer Requirement; or

(ii)

make payments on AT1 and T2 Capital instruments.

3.19.4

An Authorised Person must:

(a)

in subsequently taking any of the actions described in Rule 3.19.3(b)(i) and (ii), after having calculated the maximum distributable amount and notified the Regulator, ensure that it distributes no more than its calculated maximum distributable amount; and

(b)

prepare and submit a capital conservation plan pursuant to Rule 3.19.9.

3.19.5

(4)

a redemption or purchase by an institution of its own Shares or other capital instruments;

a repayment of amounts paid up in connection with capital; or

a distribution of other items referred to in Section 3.10 as eligible for inclusion as CET1 Capital.

In this Section, a reference to a "maximum distributable amount" means the maximum amount that an Authorised Person may distribute in connection with CET1 Capital as specified in Rules 3.19.3 and 3.19.4.

Subject to sub-paragraph (4), an Authorised Person must determine the maximum distributable amount by multiplying the sum specified in (a) by the factor determined under (b):

(a)

the total of interim or year-end profits that were not included in CET1 Capital pursuant to Rule 3.10.2 and which have accrued after the most recent distribution of profits and after any of the actions referred to in Rule 3.19.3(b);

(b)

where the CET1 Capital of the Authorised Person (which is not used to meet the Capital Requirement, including any Individual Capital Requirement as may be imposed pursuant to Chapter 10) falls:

(i) within the first quartile of the Combined Buffer Requirement, the

factor shall be 0;

(ii) within the second quartile of the Combined Buffer Requirement,

the factor shall be 0.2;

(iii) within the third quartile of the Combined Buffer Requirement, the

factor shall be 0.4;

(iv) within the fourth quartile of the Combined Buffer Requirement,

the factor shall be 0.6.

An Authorised Person must calculate the lower and upper bounds of each quartile of the Comibined Buffer requirement as follows:

Lower bound of quartile = (Combined Buffer Requirement / 4) x (Qn â€“ 1);

and

Upper bound of quartile = (Combined Buffer Requirement / 4) x Qn,

where Qn indicates the ordinal number of the quartile concerned.

If an Authorised Person undertakes any action under Rule 3.19.3(b), it must take that into account and reduce the maximum
