multiplier = a function of three inputs (V, C and AddOnaggregate), calculated in accordance with Rule A4.6.27.

A4.6.27 The multiplier input is calculated in accordance with the following formula:

multiplier = min {1;𝐹𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑟 + (1 − 𝐹𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑟)∗exp(

𝑉−𝐶 2∗(1−𝐹𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑟)∗𝐴𝑑𝑑𝑂𝑛𝑎𝑔𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑒)}

where:

exp(…) = the exponential function;

Floor = 5%;

V = the value of the derivative transactions in the netting set; and

C = the haircut value of the net collateral held, calculated in accordance with Section

A4.3.

General steps for calculating the add-on

A4.6.28 For each transaction, the Authorised Person must identify the primary risk factor or factors and attribute the transaction to one or more of the five asset classes: interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity or commodity.

A4.6.29 The Authorised Person must determine the add-on for each asset class in accordance

with the asset-class-specific formulae set out in A4.6.35 – A4.6.58.
