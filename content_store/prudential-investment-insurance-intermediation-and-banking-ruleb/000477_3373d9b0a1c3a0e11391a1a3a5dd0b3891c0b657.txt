The Regulator expects the systems and controls to include:

a.

processes for the tiered approval of Exposures based on size, risk profile and complexity;

b.

mechanisms for identifying, recording and monitoring all Exposures with particular focus on Large Exposures;

c.

mechanisms in place for the monitoring and control of Exposures to Counterparties and Groups of Connected Counterparties;

d.

mechanisms for monitoring and recording Exposures within its Group;

e.

mechanisms to monitor Counterparties in the same economic sector and exposed to single economic risks;
