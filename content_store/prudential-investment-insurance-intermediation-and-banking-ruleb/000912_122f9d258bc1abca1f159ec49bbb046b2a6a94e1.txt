Various methods can be used to hedge Market Risk. An Authorised Person should document the appropriate products to be used to hedge Exposure and identify individuals within the Authorised Person or Group responsible for monitoring hedge performance.

An Authorised Person should ensure that it makes and maintains appropriate prudential records which show and explain the Authorised Person's transactions, disclose its financial position and Exposure to Market Risk and enable it to demonstrate compliance with these rules. In particular, an Authorised Person should have data history to enable it to perform back-testing of methods and assumptions used for stress and scenario testing and for value-at-risk models. Market Risk records should be retained for at least six years.
