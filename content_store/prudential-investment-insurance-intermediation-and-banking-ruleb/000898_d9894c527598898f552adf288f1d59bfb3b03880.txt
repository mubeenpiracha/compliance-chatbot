where:

h

= the one-year risk horizon (in units of a year); h=1;

wi

= the weight applicable to counterparty i.

Counterparty i must be mapped to one of the six weights wi based on the Credit Quality Grade determined from an external credit assessment by a nominated ECAI, as set out in Table 1. For a counterparty for which a credit assessment by a nominated ECAI is not available, an Authorised Person must assign wi=1.0% to this counterparty;
