EAD = alpha* (RC + PFE)

where:

alpha = 1.4

RC = the replacement cost calculated according to Rules A4.6.19 to A4.6.24

PFE = the amount for potential future exposure calculated according to Rule A4.6.26

A4.6.16 The replacement cost (RC) and the potential future exposure (PFE) components must be calculated differently for margined and unmargined netting sets. The EAD for a margined netting set is to be capped at the EAD of the same netting set calculated on an unmargined basis.
