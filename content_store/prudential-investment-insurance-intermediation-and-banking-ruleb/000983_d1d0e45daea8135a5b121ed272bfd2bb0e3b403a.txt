Delta-weighted positions with debt Securities or interest rates as the underlying instrument must be inserted into the interest rate timebands, as set out in Section A6.2. A two-legged approach must be used as for other Derivatives, requiring one entry at the time the underlying instrument takes effect and a second at the time the underlying instrument matures. Floating rate instruments with caps or floors must be treated as a combination of floating rate Securities and a series of European-style Options.

The capital charge for Options with equities as the underlying instrument must also be based on the Delta-weighted positions which must be incorporated in the measure of Equity Risk Capital Requirement described in Section A6.3. For purposes of this calculation, each national market must be treated as a separate underlying instrument.
