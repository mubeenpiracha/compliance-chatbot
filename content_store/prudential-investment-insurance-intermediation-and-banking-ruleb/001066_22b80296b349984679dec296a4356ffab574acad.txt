Guidance

1.

In (a), the three-year average should be calculated on the basis of the last three yearly observations at the end of the Authorised Person's financial year. When audited figures are not available, business estimates may be used.

2.

As an example of the approach to be used for (a)(ii), if an Authorised Person has two positive yearly gross incomes of $20 each and the final yearly observation shows a negative figure of $5, then the average should be calculated as $20 being $40 (the sum of the positive figures) divided by 2 (the number of years for which the figures are positive).

3.

The circumstances in (b) may arise, for example, where an Authorised Person is a start-up, is part of a merger or it acquires or divests itself of a significant business unit.

4.

Net interest income in A7.1.1(4) is the interest income minus interest expense. Guidance on what constitutes interest income and interest expense can be found in the PRU rules.
