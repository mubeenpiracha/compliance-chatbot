A10.4.6

In determining the residual maturity of an instrument captured under Rule A10.4.2 or Rule A10.4.3 or any other liability that is to be included in the Available Stable Funding, an Authorised Person must calculate the residual maturity of each instrument or liability as being that period up to the earliest point in time at which an investor has the right to exercise their right to redeem their investment or withdraw that source of funding.

A10.4.7

For long-dated liabilities, the portion of cashflows falling at or beyond the six-month and one-year time horizons must be treated as having an effective residual maturity of six months or more and one year or more, respectively.

Guidance

1. When determining the maturity of a liability or a capital instrument, investors should be assumed to redeem a call option at the earliest possible date available to them. For funding with options exercisable at the discretion of an Authorised Person, the Regulator will take into account reputational factors that may limit the ability of the Authorised Person not to exercise the option. In particular, where the market expects certain liabilities to be redeemed before their legal final maturity date, Authorised Persons and the Regulator should assume such behaviour for the purpose of calculating the NSFR and include these liabilities in the corresponding ASF category.

A10.4.8

An Authorised Person must calculate its Available Stable Funding by:

(a)

assigning each capital instrument and liability to one of the categories in the following table;

(b) multiplying the Carrying Value of each capital instrument and liability by the

ASF factor associated with that category; and

(c)

summing those weighted values.
