Guidance

1.

The following Guidance sets out the Regulator's views about how the Table in Rule A10.2.15 should be applied to different items.

a.

the depositor has other established relationships with the Authorised Person that make Deposit withdrawal highly unlikely; or

b.

the Deposits are in transactional accounts (e.g. accounts where salaries are automatically credited).

4.

If an Authorised Person is not able to readily identify which retail Deposits would qualify as "stable" according to paragraph 4, it should place the full amount in the "less stable" buckets.
