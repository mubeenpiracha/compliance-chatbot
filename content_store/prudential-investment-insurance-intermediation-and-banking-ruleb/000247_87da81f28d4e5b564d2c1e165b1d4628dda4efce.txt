Based on the SREP, the Regulator will form an assessment which will be communicated to the Authorised Person and flow into the overall supervisory approach. The action required resulting from the IRAP and ICAAP will be communicated to the firm as part of a risk mitigation programme.

In relation to an Authorised Person in Category 1, 2, 3A or 5, where the Regulator does not agree with the results of the firm's ICAAP results, the Regulator will involve the firm in a dialogue to reconcile any difference in view to arrive at a consensus estimate of the capital level required to address all risks identified either by the firm or by the Regulator in its SREP. Such an estimate will be specified by the Regulator as the Individual Capital Requirement for the firm. Where consensus is not possible the Regulator may impose an Individual Capital Requirement on a firm.
