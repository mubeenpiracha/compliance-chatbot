The Net Stable Funding Ratio

Guidance

1.

Neither the NSFR, nor the LCR, should be seen by an Authorised Person as providing a complete picture of its funding profile or the stability of the funding available to it. An Authorised Person should always conduct further assessments of its funding needs and sources of funding to complement the information obtained from the two measures.

2.

Terms used for the NSFR mirror those in use for the LCR, unless otherwise stated.

A10.4.1

An Authorised Person must calculate its NSFR on an ongoing basis, using the total amount of Available Stable Funding calculated in accordance with Rule A10.4.8 and the total amount of Required Stable Funding calculated in accordance with Rule A10.4.9.
