(a)

An Authorised Person which uses the Basic Indicator Approach must calculate its Operational Risk Capital Requirement equal to the average over the previous three years of a fixed percentage (denoted by alpha) of positive annual gross income.

(ii)

For any year that annual gross income is zero or negative, that year must be excluded from both the numerator and the denominator in the calculation.

(b)

(i) Where an Authorised Person does not have sufficient data to meet the three-year requirement in (a) it must use its forecast annual gross income projections for that part of the three year time period for which it does not have sufficient historical data.
