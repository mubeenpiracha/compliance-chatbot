 in price of the underlying equities, a Future; or

(ii)

where the payout is the appreciation in price of the underlying equities, an Option, in which case the Authorised Person must calculate an Option Risk Capital Requirement in accordance with Section 5.8.

Equity Futures and forwards

A6.3.13 An Authorised Person must treat a Future or forward on a single equity as a notional position in the underlying equity. In addition, an interest rate leg must be included in the interest rate risk calculation in Section 5.4 as a notional government security.

A6.3.14 An Authorised Person must treat a Future or forward on a single country equity index

as either:

348

PRU VER17.290725

(a)

notional positions in the constituent equities; or

(b)

a single notional position.

A6.3.15 Where Rule A6.3.14(b) applies, an Authorised Person must apply the highest risk percentage to the single notional position that would apply to any one of its constituents.

A6.3.16 An Authorised Person must treat a Future or forward on a multiple country equity index

as either:

(a)

notional positions in the constituent equities; or

(b)

a number of notional positions being one for each of the countries which is represented in the index, in the proportion of that country's representation in the index.

A6.3.17 Where Rule A6.3.16(b) applies, an Authorised Person must apply the highest risk percentage to each notional position that would apply to any one of its constituents.

Equity Options and company issued Warrants

A6.3.18 An Authorised Person must treat an Option or company issued Warrant on an equity, basket of equities or equity index that is eligible to be included in the equity method as a notional position in the underlying equity or equities as follows:

(a)

a purchased call Option and a written put Option must be treated as a long position; and

(b)

a purchased put Option and a written call Option must be treated as a short position.

Netting

Guidance

1.

Before calculating the Equity Risk Capital Requirement, positions may be netted in order to produce the individual net position.

2.

Since the Netting of positions for Equity Risk Capital Requirement purposes does not involve legal or contractual issues, this material appears here rather than in the Netting Section of the Credit Risk Chapter.

A6.3.19

(1)

An Authorised Person may only net equity positions when:

(a)

long and short (including notional) positions are in the same tranche of the same equity; and

(b)

long and short (including notional) positions are in different tranches of the same equity where the tranches enjoy the same rights in all

349

PRU VER17.290725

respects and become fungible within 180 days, and thereafter the equity of one tranche can be delivered in settlement of the equity of the other tranche.

(2)

For the purposes of (1)(a), an equity is the same as another, only if they enjoy the same rights in all respects and are fungible with each other.

Calculation of the Equity Risk Capital Requirement

Guidance

There are two methods for calculating the Equity Risk Capital Requirement: the standard method and the simplified method. The standard method requires two separate calculations. The first is Specific Risk and the second is General Market Risk. The simplified method is easier to calculate but usually results in a higher Capital Requirement than the standard method. In addition, Authorised Persons must calculate an Interest Rate Risk Capital Requirement for a forward, a Future, an Option or a company issued Warrant.

A6.3.20

(1)

An Authorised Person must allocate an equity position or notional position to the country in which the equity is listed.

(2)

An equity listed in more than one country must be allocated to one of the countries in which it is listed.

A6.3.21 An Authorised Person must allocate an unlisted equity to the country in which it is

issued.

The concentration test

A6.3.22 An Authorised Person must apply either the standard method or simplified method to an equity position, except that where an individual net position exceeds 20% of the sum of the long and
