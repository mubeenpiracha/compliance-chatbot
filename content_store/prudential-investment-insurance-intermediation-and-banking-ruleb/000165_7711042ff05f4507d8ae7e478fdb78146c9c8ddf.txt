A4.6.36 SDi is determined in accordance with the following formula:

𝑆𝐷𝑖 =

exp(-0.05∗𝑆𝑖) − exp(-0.05∗𝐸𝑖) 0.05

where Si and Ei are the start and end dates, respectively, of the time period referenced by the interest rate or credit derivative, floored by ten business days.

Add-on for interest rate derivatives

A4.6.37 The add-on for interest rate derivatives is the sum of the add-ons for each hedging set of interest rate derivatives transacted with a counterparty in a netting set.

A4.6.38

Interest rate derivatives consist of a separate hedging set for each currency. Interest rate derivatives are divided into three time 'buckets' as follows: less than or equal to one year, greater than one year and lessthanor equal to five years, and more than five years.

A4.6.39 The add-on for a hedging set of interest rate derivatives is calculated in two steps:

Step 1

A4.6.40 The effective notional is calculated in accordance with the following formula:

(𝐼𝑅) = ∑ 𝛿𝑖 ∗ 𝐷𝑗𝑘 𝑖∈(𝐶𝑐𝑦𝑗,𝑀𝐵𝑘)

(𝐼𝑅) ∗ 𝑀𝐹𝑖 𝑑𝑖

(𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒)

where:

i ε (Ccyj, MBk) refers to trades of currency j that belong to maturity bucket k.

Guidance

The effect of this formula is that the effective notional for each time bucket and currency is the sum of the trade-level adjusted notional amounts multiplied by the supervisory delta adjustments and the maturity factor.

Step 2

A4.6.41 The Authorised Person must aggregate across maturity buckets for each hedging set

in accordance with the following formula:
