 to be applied using one of the following methods:

(a)

standard supervisory haircuts; or

(b)

own-estimate haircuts.

A4.3.4

[Reserved]

A4.3.5

(1)

As an alternative to the use of standard supervisory haircuts or own-estimate haircuts, an Authorised Person may, subject to approval by the Regulator, use VaR models to reflect the price volatility of the Exposure and Collateral for SFTs which are covered by a qualifying bilateral Netting agreement. The requirements relating to the use of this approach are set out in Section A4.5.

(2)

An Authorised Person may seek the approval from the Regulator referred to in (1) only if it has already received approval from the Regulator to use the internal models approach for calculating the Market Risk Capital Requirement.

Guidance

Approval for the use of the internal model approach is governed by Section 5.11 of Chapter 5 (Market Risk).

A4.3.6

An Authorised Person using standard supervisory haircuts or own-estimate haircuts under the FCCA must calculate E* for any collateralised transaction not covered by a qualifying bilateral Netting agreement or a qualifying cross-product Netting agreement other than OTC Derivative transactions or long settlement transactions, using the following formula:

E* = max {0, [E(1 + HE) - C(1 – HC – HFX)]}

where:

E*

=

Exposure value after risk mitigation;

E

=

fair value of the Exposure calculated in accordance with Section 4.9;

HE

=

haircut appropriate to the Exposure;

C

=

fair value of the eligible financial Collateral received;

HC

=

haircut appropriate to the Collateral, or if the Collateral is a basket of assets, the weighted sum of the haircuts appropriate to the assets in the basket where each weight is the proportion of the asset in the basket in units of currency; and

HFX =

haircut appropriate Collateral and Exposure.

for currency mismatch between the

Guidance

Where the residual maturity of the Collateral is shorter than the residual maturity of the Exposure, the Authorised Person must substitute PA calculated in accordance with Rules 4.13.14 to 4.13.16 for C(1 – HC – HFX).

A4.3.7

An Authorised Person using standard supervisory haircuts or own-estimate haircuts under the FCCA must calculate E* for any collateralised transaction covered by a qualifying bilateral Netting agreement or qualifying cross-product Netting agreement other than OTC Derivative transactions or long settlement transactions, using the following formula:

𝐸∗ = Max {0, [∑(𝐸) −∑(𝐶) + add-on]}

where:

E*

=

Exposure value after risk mitigation;

E

=

fair value of the Exposure calculated Section 4.9 of these Rules;

in accordance with

C

=

fair value of eligible financial Collateral received; and

add-on

=

the add-on amount to reflect the market price volatility and foreign exchange accordance with Rule A4.3.8 below.

volatility,

calculated

in

A4.3.8

An Authorised Person must calculate the add-on using one of the following approaches:

(a)

the approach according to the following formula:

𝑎𝑑𝑑 − 𝑜𝑛 = ∑(𝐸𝑆.𝐻𝑆) +∑(𝐸𝐹𝑋.𝐻𝐹𝑋)

where:

ES

=

absolute value of the net position in a given Security;

HS

=

haircut appropriate to ES

EFX

=

absolute value of the net position in a currency different from the settlement currency; and

HFX

=

haircut appropriate for currency mismatch between the Collateral and Exposure;

or

(b)

the approach using VaR models, provided the Authorised Person has received approval from the Regulator as referred to in Rule A4.3.5.
