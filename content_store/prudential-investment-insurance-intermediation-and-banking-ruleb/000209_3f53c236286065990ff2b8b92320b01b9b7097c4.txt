Warrants are being underwritten.

Guidance

1.

Sub-Underwriting is a commitment given by one firm to someone other than the Issuer or seller of the Securities to sub-underwrite all or part of an issue of Securities. The net Underwriting position calculated in Rule A6.8.6 will also be used in calculating the net Underwriting Exposure under Rules A6.8.11 to A6.8.14.

2.

The net Underwriting position or reduced net Underwriting position arising from Underwriting or sub-Underwriting a rights or Warrants issue should be calculated using the current market price of the underlying Security for the purposes of the Equity Risk Capital Requirement or Option Risk Capital Requirement. However, the risk Capital Requirements will be limited to the value of the net Underwriting position calculated using the initial issue price of the rights or Warrants. Where there is no market price because the rights or Warrants are in relation to a new class of Securities and the initial price has not been set the net Underwriting position or reduced net Underwriting is the amount of the commitment.

Commitment to underwrite Securities

A6.8.3

(1)

For the purpose of Rule A6.8.1, an Authorised Person underwrites or sub-underwrites an issue of Securities where:

(a)

it gives a commitment to an Issuer of Securities to underwrite an issue of Securities;

(b)

in the case of new Securities (as defined in Rule A6.8.4) it gives a commitment to a seller of Securities to underwrite a sale of those Securities;

(c)

it gives a commitment to a Person, other than the Issuer of Securities or, if (b) applies, the seller of the Securities, to sub-underwrite an issue of Securities; or

PRU VER17.290725

(d)

it is a member of a syndicate or Group that gives a commitment of the type described in (a) to (c).

(2)

Unless a Rule deals with an issue of Securities separately or the context otherwise requires, a provision of Section A6.8 that deals with Underwriting also applies to sub-Underwriting.

Guidance

Block trades, including bought deals, and private placements are not within the scope of this Chapter because they involve an outright purchase by an Authorised Person of the relevant Securities.

A6.8.4

For the purposes of Rule A6.8.3(b), an Authorised Person must treat Securities as being new if they are:

(a)

Securities that, prior to the allotment following the Underwriting, were not in issue; or

(b)

Securities that have not previously been offered for sale or subscription to the public and have not been admitted to trading on a market operated by a Recognised Body or an overseas investment exchange.

Grey market transactions

A6.8.5

(1)

An Authorised Person that buys and sells Securities before issue is dealing in the grey market for the purposes of this Section.

(2)

The other Rules in Section A6.8 do not apply to an Authorised Person with respect to its dealings in the grey market unless the Authorised Person:

(a)

has an Underwriting commitment to the Issuer in respect of those Securities; or

(b)

has a sub-Underwriting commitment in respect of those Securities and is using the grey market solely for the purpose of reducing that sub-Underwriting commitment.

(3)

The other Rules in Section A6.8 do not apply to an Authorised Person with respect to its dealings in the grey market if the transaction is undertaken by the proprietary trading part of the Authorised Person or is undertaken for proprietary trading purposes.

Guidance

In Rule A6.8.5, the grey market is the market in which dealers "buy" and "sell" Securities ahead of issue. In reality the dealers are buying and selling promises to deliver the Securities when issued.

Calculating the net Underwriting position

A6.8.6

An Authorised Person must calculate a net Underwriting position from the date of initial commitment until the Underwriting process ends, as the initial gross commitment adjusted for:

(a)

Underwriting or sub-Underwriting commitments obtained from others since the time of initial commitment;

(b)

purchases or sales of the Securities since the time of initial commitment;
