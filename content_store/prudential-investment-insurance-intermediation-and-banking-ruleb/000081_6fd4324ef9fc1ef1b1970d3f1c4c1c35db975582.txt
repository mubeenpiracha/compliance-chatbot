include any guarantee with a cancellation Rule 4.13.9(2)(e) does not clause where it is provided that any obligation incurred or transaction entered into prior to any cancellation, unilateral or otherwise, continues to be guaranteed by the guarantor.

In addition to the requirements in Rule 4.13.9, where an Authorised Person has an Exposure that is protected by a guarantee or that is counter-guaranteed by a central government or central bank, a regional government or local authority or a PSE claims on which are treated as claims on the central government in whose jurisdiction they are established, a MDB or an international organisation to which a 0% risk weight is assigned under Section 4.12, an Authorised Person may treat the Exposure as being protected by a direct guarantee from the central government or central bank in question, provided the following requirements are complied with:

(a)

the counter-guarantee covers all Credit Risk elements of the Exposure;

(b)

both the original guarantee and the counter-guarantee comply with all the in this Section, except that the requirements for guarantees set out counter-guarantee need not be direct and explicit with respect to the original Exposure; and
