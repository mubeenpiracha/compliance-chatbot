Group of Closely Related Counterparties

A4.11.5

(1)

An Authorised Person need not assess whether Persons are economically independent for a transaction where the sum of all Exposures to one individual Counterparty is less than 5% of the Authorised Personâ€™s Tier 1.

(2)

The Regulator may, at its discretion, require an Authorised Person to treat two or more Persons as Closely Related to each other and to aggregate Exposures to such Persons accordingly.

(3)

Persons who are Closely Related to each other are also Connected with each other.

(4)

The requirement to aggregate Exposures where Persons are Closely Related does not apply where an Authorised Person can demonstrate to the Regulator that it is unlikely that Persons who are Closely Related will default at the same time and the Regulator has, by notice in writing, disapplied the requirement.

Connected Counterparties

A4.11.7

(1)

The Regulator may, at its discretion, require an Authorised Person to treat a Person as a Connected Counterparty of another Person and to aggregate Exposures to such Persons accordingly.

(2)

A Person is not considered to be a Connected Counterparty, where an Authorised Person can satisfy the Regulator that effective governance and controls are in place to mitigate risks resulting from effective control of one Person by the other and the Regulator has, by notice in writing, specified that they are not to be so considered.

Guidance

A group of Connected Counterparties would be considered to be such where the entities share the same ultimate owner even though they may not be formally structured as a Group.

Exposures to transactions, schemes or Funds

A4.11.8 Where an Authorised Person has an Exposure to a transaction, scheme, Fund, or other Exposure to a pool of underlying Exposures, the Authorised Person must assess the Exposure to determine whether the Exposure is a group of Closely Related Counterparties in its economic substance.

Guidance

1.

When considering this Rule the Authorised Person should consider the following factors:

a.

the structure, independence and control of the transaction, including governance arrangements;

b.

the inter relatedness of the underlying Exposures;

c.

beneficial owners of the underlying Exposures and whether they could be deemed Connected or Closely Related; and

d.

whether the transactions are conducted on an arm's length basis.

2.

An Authorised Person should look through the structure to determine whether there are any Counterparties or Exposures that might give rise to risks arising from a Large Exposure.
