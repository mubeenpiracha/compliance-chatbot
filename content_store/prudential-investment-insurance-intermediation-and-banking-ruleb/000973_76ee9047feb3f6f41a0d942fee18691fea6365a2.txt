Maturity Ladder approach

A6.5.5

(1)

An Authorised Person which uses the Maturity Ladder approach to calculate the Commodities Risk Capital Requirement must:

(a)

express each commodity position (spot and forward) in terms of the standard unit of measurement and net long and short positions maturing on the same day or maturing within ten business days of each other in the case of contracts traded in markets with daily delivery dates;

(b)

allocate the positions remaining after taking the steps in (a) to the appropriate maturity band in the following table:

Band 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

Maturity of Position 0 to 1 month 1 to 3 months 3 to 6 months 6 to 12 months 1 to 2 years 2 to 3 years Over 3 years

(c)

calculate the spread charge each time long and short positions are matched within each band. In each instance, the spread charge equals the matched amount multiplied first by the unit spot price for the commodity and then by a spread rate of 1.5%;

(d)
