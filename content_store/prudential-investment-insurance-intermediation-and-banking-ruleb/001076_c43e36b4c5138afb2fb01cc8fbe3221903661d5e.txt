Principles for business line mapping

6.

All activities should be mapped into the eight level 1 business lines in a mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive manner.

7.

Any activity which cannot be readily mapped into the business line framework, but which represents an ancillary function to an activity included in the framework, should be allocated to the business line it supports. If more

than one business line is supported through the ancillary activity, an objective mapping criteria should be used.

8.

When mapping gross income, if an activity cannot be mapped into a particular business line then the business line yielding the highest charge should be used. The same business line equally applies to any associated ancillary activity.

9.

An Authorised Person may use internal pricing methods to allocate gross income between business lines, provided that total gross income for the firm (as would be recorded under the Basic Indicator Approach) still equals the sum of gross income for the eight business lines.
