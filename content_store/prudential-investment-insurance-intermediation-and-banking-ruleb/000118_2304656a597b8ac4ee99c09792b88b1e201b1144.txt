Domestic Systemically Important Banks

Guidance

1.

This section provides for the Regulator to be able to designate an Authorised Person as a D-SIB. A D-SIB is a bank whose impact, if it were to fail, is likely to cause significant disruption to the domestic financial system and the broader real economy. The Regulator will, in assessing if it should designate an Authorised Person as a D-SIB, take into account the factors suggested by the Basel Committee in its framework for domestic systemically important banks. Those factors include the size, interconnectedness, substitutability and the complexity of the firm.

2.

In order to address the additional risks that D-SIBs pose, they may be subject to specific regulatory and supervisory measures, including more intensive supervision and/or higher capital requirements, amongst other measures.
