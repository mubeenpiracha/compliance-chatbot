Currency mismatches

4.13.13

(1)

In the case where there is a currency mismatch between the credit protection and the underlying Exposure, an Authorised Person must reduce the amount of the Exposure deemed to be protected by applying a haircut, as follows:

Protected portion GA = G (1- HFX)

where:

(a)

G = notional amount of the credit protection; and

(b)

HFX = haircut appropriate for currency mismatch between the credit protection and underlying obligation Exposure based on a ten-business day holding period, assuming daily mark-to-market.

(2)

An Authorised Person must determine HFX in the following manner:

(a)

if the Authorised Person uses standard supervisory haircuts, HFX is 8%; and

(b)

if the Authorised Person uses own-estimate haircuts, it must estimate HFX according to Rules A4.3.6 to A4.3.26 in App4 based on a ten-business day holding period, assuming daily mark-to-market.

(3)

If the credit protection is not marked-to-market daily, HFX must be scaled in accordance with Rule A4.3.25.
