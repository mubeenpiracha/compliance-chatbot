Guidance

1.

Guidance on the characteristics of “stable”, “less stable” and “operational” Deposits and PSIAus is given under A10.2.15.

2.

In order to calculate the value of Shari’a compliant hedging liabilities (e.g. Islamic swaps), the replacement cost must be obtained for the Shari’a compliant hedging contracts (obtained by marking to market), such as ISDA/IIFM Tahawwut Master Agreement (TMA), where the contract has a negative value. When an eligible bilateral netting contract is in place, the replacement cost for the set of Shari’a compliant hedging exposures covered by the contract will be the net replacement cost.

3.

In calculating the NSFR, collateral posted in the form of variation margin that follows Shari’a principles in connection with Shari’a compliant hedging contracts as in the TMA contract, regardless of the asset type, must be deducted from the negative replacement cost amount of the corresponding Shari’a compliant hedging liabilities.
