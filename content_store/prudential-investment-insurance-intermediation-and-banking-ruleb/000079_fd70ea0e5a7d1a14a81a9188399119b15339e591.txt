Collateral

Guidance

In order to recognise the effects of CRM of the types of Collateral set out in Rules 4.13.5 to 4.13.7, an Authorised Person must ensure that the relevant requirements in Rule 4.13.8 are complied with.

4.13.5

(1)

For an Authorised Person using the FCSA, eligible financial Collateral comprises:

(a)

cash (as well as certificates of Deposit or other similar instruments issued by the Authorised Person) on Deposit with the Authorised Person;

(b)

gold;

(c)

any debt security:

(i)

with an Original Maturity of one year or less that has a short-term Credit Quality Grade of 3 or better as set out in Section 4.12; or

(ii)

with an Original Maturity of more than one year that has a Credit Quality Grade of 4 or better as set out in Section 4.12 if it is issued by a central government or central bank, or a Credit Quality Grade of 3 or better as set out in Section 4.12 if it is issued by any other entity;

(d)

any debt security issued by a bank that does not have an external credit assessment by an ECAI if it fulfils the following criteria:

(i)

any debt security which is listed on a regulated exchange;

(ii)

the debt security is classified as senior debt, not subordinated to any other debt obligations of its Issuer;

(iii)

all other rated debt Securities issued by the same Issuer which rank equally with the mentioned debt security have a long term or short term (as applicable) Credit Quality Grade by an ECAI of "3" or better;

(iv)

the Authorised Person is not aware of information to suggest that the issue would justify a Credit Quality Grade of below "3" as indicated in (iii) above; and

(v)

the Authorised Person can demonstrate to the Regulator that the market liquidity of the debt security is sufficient to enable the Authorised Person to dispose the debt security at market price;

(e)

any equity security (including convertible bonds) that is included in a main index; or

(f)

any Unit in a Collective Investment Fund where:

(i)

a price for the units is publicly quoted daily; and

(ii)

at least 90% of the deposited property of the Fund is invested in instruments listed in this Rule.

(2)

Cash-funded CLNs issued by an Authorised Person against Exposures in the Non-Trading Book which fulfil the criteria for eligible Credit Derivatives must be treated as cash collateralised transactions.

(3)

Cash, mentioned in (1)(a), includes cash on Deposit, certificates of Deposit or other similar instruments issued by the Authorised Person that are held as Collateral at a third-party bank in a non-custodial arrangement and that are pledged or assigned to the Authorised Person. This is subject to the pledge or assignment being unconditional and irrevocable. Under the FCSA, the risk weight to be applied to the Exposure covered by such Collateral must be the risk weight of the third-party bank.

Guidance

1.

For the purposes of Rule 4.13.5 and 4.13.6, eligible financial Collateral excludes any T1 Capital instrument or T2 Capital instrument issued by any entity in the Financial Group of the Authorised Person, which is held by the Authorised Person or any of its Financial Group entities as Collateral.

2.

For an Authorised Person using Units of a Fund under the FCSA approach, the use or potential use by that Fund of Derivative instruments solely to hedge Investments listed in Rule 4.13.5 should not preclude the Units in that Fund from being recognised as eligible financial Collateral.

4.13.6

For an Authorised Person using the FCCA, eligible financial Collateral comprises:

(a)

any instrument listed in Rule 4.13.5;

(b)

any equity Security (including a convertible bond) that is traded on a regulated exchange; and

(c)

any Unit in a Collective Investment Fund which invests in equity Securities referred to in (b), where:

(i)

a price for the Units is publicly quoted
