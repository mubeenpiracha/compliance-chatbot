5.

Less stable Deposits should consist of the portion of Deposits that do not meet the conditions in paragraph 4 and also include types of Deposits more likely to be withdrawn in a time of stress. These should include high-value Deposits (i.e. Deposits above any Deposit insurance limit), Deposits from customers who do not have established relationships with an Authorised Person that make the Deposit withdrawal unlikely, Deposits from sophisticated or high net worth individuals, Deposits where the internet is integral to the design, marketing and use of the account (on-line accounts) and Deposits with promotional interest rates (i.e. that are heavily rate-driven).
