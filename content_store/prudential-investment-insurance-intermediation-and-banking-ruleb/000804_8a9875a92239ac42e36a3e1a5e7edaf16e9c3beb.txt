RC = max{V – C; TH + MTA – NICA; 0}

where:

V = the value of the derivative transactions in the netting set (constituted in

accordance with Rule A4.6.18);

C = the haircut value of the net collateral held, calculated in accordance with Section

TH = the positive threshold before the counterparty is required to send the Authorised

Person collateral;

MTA = the minimum transfer amount applicable to the counterparty;

NICA = the net independent collateral amount.
