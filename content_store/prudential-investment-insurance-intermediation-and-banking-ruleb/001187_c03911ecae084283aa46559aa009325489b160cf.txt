The Regulator's assessment of the individual risk profile of an Authorised Person will provide the context for evaluation of the firm's IRAP and/or ICAAP. The evaluation in turn will be used by the Regulator to augment its understanding of the overall risk profile of a firm. Also, in relation to a firm in Category 1, 2, 3A or 5, the Regulator might involve such a firm in a formalised discussion of risks and capital adequacy, which might lead to a requirement for additional capital.

The SREP may be used as a regulatory tool for Authorised Persons which are required to perform an IRAP and/or ICAAP. The SREP for each Authorised Person will be proportionate in terms of the size, scale and complexity of its business and its impact on financial sector stability. The Regulator will cooperate actively with other supervisory authorities whenever an Authorised Person is part of a Group and is prudentially regulated on a consolidated basis.
