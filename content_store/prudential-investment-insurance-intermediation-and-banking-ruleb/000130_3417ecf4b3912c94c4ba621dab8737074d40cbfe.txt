CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE

Guidance

1.

This Chapter deals with all aspects of prudential requirements relating to the capital adequacy of Authorised Persons, in terms of both quantity and quality, and, where appropriate, the maintenance of liquid assets. (Chapter 9 covers more generally the related prudential topic of liquidity, the ability of an Authorised Person to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.) The Chapter outlines the minimum capital requirements that an Authorised Person should meet, consistent with Pillar 1 of the Basel Accord, and aims to ensure that an Authorised Person maintains adequate capital resources to support the risks associated with its activities and that it can fully absorb unexpected losses at any time. A summary of the minimum capital requirements is given in App 3.2.

2.

This Chapter also includes provisions forming part of the framework for the assessment by the Regulator, under Pillar 2 of the Basel Accord, of the capital adequacy of an Authorised Person, with further detail given in Chapter 10. The disclosure requirements placed upon an Authorised Person under Pillar 3 of the Basel Accord are covered in Chapter 11.
