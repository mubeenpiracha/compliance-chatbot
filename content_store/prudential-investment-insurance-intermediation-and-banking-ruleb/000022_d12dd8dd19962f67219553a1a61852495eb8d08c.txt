Domestic Systemically Important Banks

Guidance

1.

This section provides for the Regulator to be able to designate an Authorised Person as a D-SIB. A D-SIB is a bank whose impact, if it were to fail, is likely to cause significant disruption to the domestic financial system and the broader real economy. The Regulator will, in assessing if it should designate an Authorised Person as a D-SIB, take into account the factors suggested by the Basel Committee in its framework for domestic systemically important banks. Those factors include the size, interconnectedness, substitutability and the complexity of the firm.

2.

In order to address the additional risks that D-SIBs pose, they may be subject to specific regulatory and supervisory measures, including more intensive supervision and/or higher capital requirements, amongst other measures.

3.

The Regulator may designate an Authorised Person as a D-SIB whether it is a Domestic Firm or a Branch. However, the measures that apply to a D-SIB that is a Branch will be less extensive than those that apply to one that is a Domestic Firm. For example, while both may be subject to more intensive supervision, a D-SIB that is a Branch would not be subject to higher capital requirements as those in chapter 3 do not apply to a Branch as it is subject to the capital requirements of its Home State Regulator.

1.4.1

(1)

The Regulator may designate an Authorised Person as a D-SIB where:

(a)

it is a Domestic Firm or Branch in Category 1 or 5; and

(b)

the Regulator considers that the risks associated with the Authorised Person are such that, if it were to fail, it could have a significant impact on the effective working and stability of the domestic banking or financial system.

1.4.2

(1)

The Regulator must publish a copy of any designation made under this section or any amendment or cancellation of that designation.

(2)

The procedures in Part 21 of FSMR apply to a decision to designate an Authorised Person as a D-SIB or to amend the designation.

(3) Where the Regulator decides to designate an Authorised Person as a D-SIB or to amend the designation, the Authorised Person may refer the matter to the Appeals Panel for review.
