 Security denominated in the currency in which the dual currency bond is issued; and

a foreign exchange forward for the purchase of the redemption currency (see Section 5.6).

Requirement on the Security because, although legal ownership transfers to the Counterparty, the economic benefit or loss remains with the Authorised Person.

Cash legs of reverse repos

A6.2.12

(1)

The forward cash leg of a reverse repo must be treated as a notional long position in a government security with a maturity equal to that of the reverse repo and coupon equal to the repo rate.

(2)

An Authorised Person may exclude from the interest rate maturity framework (for both Specific and General Market Risk) long and short positions (both actual and notional) in identical Derivative instruments with exactly the same Issuer, coupon, currency and maturity. A fully-matched position in a Future or forward and its corresponding underlying instrument may also be fully offset, and thus excluded from the calculation.

Guidance

If a Security is subject to a reverse repurchase agreement (but not a repurchase agreement), the Authorised Person does not calculate an Interest Rate Risk Capital Requirement on the Security because, although the firm obtains the legal title, the economic benefit or loss remains with the original holder.

Specific Risk

Guidance

In respect of interest rate risk, a capital charge for Specific Risk is designed to protect against an adverse movement in the price of an individual Security owing to factors related to the individual Issuer.

A6.2.13

(1)

An Authorised Person must calculate its Specific Risk as the sum of the market values of the individual net positions (whether they are long or short) multiplied by the appropriate risk percentage in (3).

(2)

An Authorised Person must not offset between different issues.

(3)

An Authorised Person must determine the appropriate risk percentage by reference to the following table:
