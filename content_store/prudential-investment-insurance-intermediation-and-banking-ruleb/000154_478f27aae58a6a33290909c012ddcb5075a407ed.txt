Guidance

Approval for the use of the internal model approach is governed by Section 5.11 of Chapter 5.

A4.3.9

Subject to Rules A4.3.10 to A4.3.12, an Authorised Person must determine HE, HC, HS and HFX referred to in Rules A4.3.6 to A4.3.8, in accordance with the standard supervisory haircuts in the table forming part of Rule A4.3.13.

A4.3.10 An Authorised Person may calculate HE, HC, HS and HFX using own-estimate haircuts in accordance with Rules A4.3.17 to A4.3.23 if it has received approval from the Regulator to use the internal models approach for calculating the Market Risk Capital Requirement. If the Authorised Person chooses to use own-estimate haircuts, it must do so consistently for determining haircuts for all eligible financial Collateral and all portfolios, except that it may, with the approval of the Regulator, use the standard supervisory haircuts in Rules A4.3.13 to A4.3.16 for any portfolio which is immaterial in size and risk profile.

A4.3.11 An Authorised Person may apply a value of zero to HE, HC and HS in the case of a qualifying SFT with a core market participant. This approach is not available to an Authorised Person using VaR models in accordance with Section A4.5 to calculate E*.

A4.3.12 An Authorised Person may apply a value of zero to HE, HC and HS in the case of an SFT where both the Exposure and Collateral are Securities issued by central governments where a value of zero has been prescribed by the banking regulator of that jurisdiction and Exposures to the central government of that jurisdiction have a Credit Quality Grade of 1 as set out in the table in Rule 4.12.4.

Standard supervisory haircuts

A4.3.13 The standard supervisory haircuts, HE, HC and HS, referred in Rules A4.3.6 to A4.3.8 (assuming daily remargining, daily revaluation and a ten-business day holding period), are subject to Rule A4.3.14, as follows:
