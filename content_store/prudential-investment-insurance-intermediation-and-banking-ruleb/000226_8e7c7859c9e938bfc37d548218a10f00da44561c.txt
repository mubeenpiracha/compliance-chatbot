High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA)

Guidance

Assets that meet the conditions in Rules A10.2.2 to A10.2.9 are considered to be HQLA. Those assets are considered to be HQLA as they can be converted easily and immediately into cash at little or no loss of value. To qualify as HQLA, assets should be liquid in markets during a time of stress. In determining whether or not the market for an asset can be relied upon to raise liquidity during a time of stress, the following factors should be taken into account:

1.

fundamental characteristics, for example:

a.

low risk: high credit standing of the Issuer and a low degree of inflation risk, low subordination, denomination in a convertible currency with low foreign exchange risk;

low duration,

legal risk,

low

b.

ease and certainty of valuation;

c.

low correlation with risky assets, not subject to wrong-way risk; and

d.

listing on a developed and recognised exchange.

2.

market-related characteristics, for example:

a.

active and sizeable market, including active outright sale or repo markets at all times. This can be demonstrated through:

i.

historical evidence of market breadth and market depth (low bid-ask spreads, high trading volumes, large and diverse number of market participants); or

ii.

existence of robust market infrastructure (presence of multiple committed market makers);

b.

low price volatility, including historical evidence of relative stability of market terms (e.g. prices and haircuts) and volumes during stressed periods; or

c.

'flight to quality', i.e. that historically the market has shown a tendency to move into these types of high quality assets in a systemic crisis.

the assets must be under the control of the specific function or functions charged with managing the liquidity of the Authorised Person which must have the continuous authority and legal and operational capability to liquidate any asset in the stock; and

(b)

a representative portion of the assets in the stock of HQLA must be liquidated periodically and at least annually by the Authorised Person to test its access to the market, the effectiveness of its processes for liquidation, the availability of the assets, and to minimise the risk of negative signalling during a period of actual stress.

A10.2.4 To be eligible as HQLA, an asset must also meet the following requirements:

(a)

the asset must be unencumbered and free of legal, regulatory, contractual or other restrictions that affect the ability of the Authorised Person to liquidate, sell, transfer, or assign the asset;

(b)

the asset must not be pledged, either explicitly or implicitly, to secure, collateralise or credit-enhance any transaction, nor be designated to cover operational costs (such as rents and salaries); and

(c)

an asset received in a reverse repo or Securities Financing Transactions that is held at the Authorised Person, is eligible for inclusion in the stock of HQLA only if the asset has not been rehypothecated and is legally and contractually available for the Authorised Person's use.
