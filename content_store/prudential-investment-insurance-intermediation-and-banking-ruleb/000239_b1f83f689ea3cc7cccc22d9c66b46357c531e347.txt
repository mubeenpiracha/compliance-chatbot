Guidance

1.

Guidance on the characteristics of “stable”, “less stable” and “operational” Deposits and PSIAus is given under A10.2.15.

2.

In order to calculate the value of Shari’a compliant hedging liabilities (e.g. Islamic swaps), the replacement cost must be obtained for the Shari’a compliant hedging contracts (obtained by marking to market), such as ISDA/IIFM Tahawwut Master Agreement (TMA), where the contract has a negative value. When an eligible bilateral netting contract is in place, the replacement cost for the set of Shari’a compliant hedging exposures covered by the contract will be the net replacement cost.

3.

In calculating the NSFR, collateral posted in the form of variation margin that follows Shari’a principles in connection with Shari’a compliant hedging contracts as in the TMA contract, regardless of the asset type, must be deducted from the negative replacement cost amount of the corresponding Shari’a compliant hedging liabilities.

Required Stable Funding (RSF)

A10.4.9

Subject to Rules A10.4.15, an Authorised Person must calculate its Required Stable Funding as the sum of the Required Stable Funding for its assets and for its off- balance sheet items, calculated in accordance with Rules A10.4.16, A10.4.18 and A10.4.19.

A10.4.10

In calculating the Required Stable Funding, an Authorised Person must, subject to (b) and (c):

(a)

(i)

include financial instruments, foreign currencies and commodities for which a purchase order has been executed; and

(ii)

exclude financial instruments, foreign currencies and commodities for which a sales order has been executed.

(b)

(i)

The effects of such transactions must be reflected in the balance sheet of the Authorised Person when settled; and

(ii)

such transactions must not be reflected as derivatives or secured financing transactions in the balance sheet of the Authorised Person.

(c)

This treatment is to be applied whether or not such transactions have been reflected in the balance sheet under a settlement-date accounting model.

A10.4.11 Where the value of a Derivative Contract represents an asset for an Authorised

Person, the Authorised Person must:

423

PRU VER17.290725

(a)

calculate the positive value of the asset as the replacement cost for the contract, obtained by marking-to-market; and

(b)

deduct any collateral received in the form of variation margin from the positive replacement cost amount.

A10.4.12 An Authorised Person may use the net replacement cost as the replacement cost for a set of derivative exposures between the Authorised Person and a Counterparty where the following conditions are met:

(a)

an eligible bilateral netting contract must be in place between the Authorised Person and the Counterparty that is binding on the Authorised Person and the Counterparty and that is legally enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions;

(b)

that contract is a qualified financial contract as specified in the ADGM Insolvency Regulations and meets the conditions specified in Part 7, Chapter 2 therein; and

(c)

the Authorised Person meets the disclosure requirements for the NSFR
