The SREP in detail

3.

A SREP of an IRAP and an ICAAP forms an integral part of the overall supervisory approach of the Regulator. A SREP is expected to enable assessment of the effectiveness, completeness and quality of an IRAP and ICAAP in relation to the overall risk profile of the Authorised Person. It leverages from information collected and assessments carried out as part of the wider supervisory regime, including desk-based reviews, on-site risk assessments, discussions with the firm's management, and reviews completed by internal and external Auditors.

The SREP is structured to provide consistency of treatment across Authorised Persons, taking into consideration the differences in risk profiles, business strategies and management. An essential element of the SREP is the qualitative assessment of each type of risk and its management within the overall context of the firm's internal governance.
