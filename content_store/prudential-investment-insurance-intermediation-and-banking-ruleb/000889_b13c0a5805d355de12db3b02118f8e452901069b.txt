Guidance

The consensus country risk classification for the purpose of the "Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits" is published by the OECD. At the time of the making of these Rules, the classification was available on the website of the OECD on the Export Credit Arrangement web-page of the Trade and Agriculture Directorate (http://www.oecd.org/trade/xcred/cre-crc-current-english.pdf).

A4.12.5 An Authorised Person must apply a 0% risk weight to any CR Exposure to any central government or any central bank of a GCC member country, which is denominated in the domestic currency, and funded in the domestic currency of that GCC member country.

A4.12.6 For any CR Exposure to any other central government or central bank which is denominated and funded in the local currency of that jurisdiction, an Authorised Person may apply such risk weights as may be specified by the banking regulator of that jurisdiction.
