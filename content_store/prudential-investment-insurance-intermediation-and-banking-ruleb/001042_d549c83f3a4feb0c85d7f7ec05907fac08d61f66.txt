21.

An internal model used for calculating Capital Requirements for Specific Risk and an internal model for correlation trading should meet the following additional requirements:

a.

it explains the historical price variation in the portfolio;

b.

it captures concentration in terms of magnitude and changes of composition of the portfolio;

c.

it is robust to an adverse environment;

d.

it is validated through back-testing aimed at assessing whether Specific Risk is being accurately captured. If the Authorised Person performs such back-testing on the basis of relevant sub-portfolios, these must be chosen in a consistent manner;
