member in accordance with the following formula:

𝐾𝐶𝑀𝑖 = max (𝐾𝐶𝐶𝑃 ∙ (

𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑓

𝐷𝐹𝑖 𝐷𝐹𝐶𝐶𝑃 + 𝐷𝐹𝐶𝑀

𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑓);10% ∗ 2% ∗ 𝐷𝐹𝑖

where:

KCMi = the capital requirement on the default fund contribution of clearing member i;

DFpref

CM = the total prefunded default fund contributions from clearing members;

DFCCP = the prefunded own resources of the CCP (e.g. contributed capital, retained earnings, etc.), which are contributed to the default waterfall, where these are junior or pari passu to prefunded member contributions; and
