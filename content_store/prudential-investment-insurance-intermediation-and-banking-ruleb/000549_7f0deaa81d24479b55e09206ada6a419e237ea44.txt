Guidance

1.

A Third Party Provider’s risk profile is that of a financial services firm and not of a software development firm, notwithstanding that software is a key component of a Third Party Provider’s business model.

2.

Rule 6.12A.2 requires a Third Party Provider to maintain sufficient professional indemnity insurance coverage to reimburse Customers should operational risk events occur.

3.

A Third Party Provider is expected to manage the size and volume of its Third Party Transactions within its remaining professional indemnity insurance cover. Such management could take place through imposing limits on the number or value of transactions.

4.

A Third Party Provider should review the adequacy of its professional indemnity insurance cover periodically to determine whether, based on its projected number or value of transactions, it should increase the value of its professional indemnity insurance coverage.
