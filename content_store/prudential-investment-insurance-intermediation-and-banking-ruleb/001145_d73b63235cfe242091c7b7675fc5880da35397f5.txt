For Required Stable Funding, i.e. covering assets and off-balance sheet items, the RSF factors again reflect the tenor of the assets. The calibration of the factors assumes that short-dated assets should attract lower RSF factors as a proportion of them could be allowed to run to maturity instead of requiring further funding in the event of their being rolled over, which may also be influenced by the desire to maintain customer relationships. Similarly, unencumbered, high-quality assets may be more easily securitised or traded to provide additional funding and this is recognised in lower RSF factors.
