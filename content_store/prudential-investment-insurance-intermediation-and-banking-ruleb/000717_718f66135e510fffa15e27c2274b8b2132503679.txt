Credit approval procedures

18.

An Authorised Person should adhere closely to the "Know Your Customer" principle and should not lend purely on name and relationship without a comprehensive assessment of the credit quality of the borrower.

19.

Credit decisions should be supported by adequate evaluation of the borrower's repayment ability based on reliable information. Sufficient and up-to-date information should continue to be available to enable effective monitoring of the account.

20.

All credits should be granted on an arm's length basis. Credits to related borrowers should be monitored carefully and steps taken to control or reduce the risks of Connected lending.

21.

An Authorised Person should not rely excessively on Collateral or guarantees as Credit Risk mitigants. Such Credit Risk mitigants may provide secondary protection to the lender if the borrower defaults, the primary consideration for credit approval should be the borrower's debt-servicing capacity.
