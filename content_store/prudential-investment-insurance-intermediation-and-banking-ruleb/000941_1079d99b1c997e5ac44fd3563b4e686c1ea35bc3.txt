Duration Method

A6.2.19 An Authorised Person with the necessary capability may, with the written consent of the Regulator, use the Duration Method, which produces a more accurate measure for General Market Risk than the Maturity Method. An Authorised Person must elect and use the Duration Method on a continuous basis and will be subject to supervisory monitoring of the systems used.

A6.2.20 Under the Duration Method, the following steps must be carried out:

(a)

the duration weighted position for each instrument must be calculated by multiplying the market value of each individual long or short net position by the Modified Duration in years and the assumed interest rate change in the table below;

(b)

the sum of the weighted long and the sum of the weighted short positions in each time band must be calculated;

(c)

these weighted long and short positions must be matched within a maturity band to give the total matched weighted position in the maturity band and the total unmatched weighted position which will be long or short in the maturity band;
