Prudent valuation practices

Guidance

1.

This Section and related Section A2.5 in App2 provide Authorised Persons with Guidance on prudent valuation for positions that are accounted for at fair value, whether they are in the Trading Book or in the Non-Trading Book (also known as the banking book).

2.

A framework for prudent valuation practices should at a minimum include adequate systems and controls and valuation methodologies. The Regulator's expectations in this regard are set out in Section A2.5 in App2.

3.

The Guidance is especially important for positions without actual market prices or observable inputs to valuation, as well as less liquid positions which raise supervisory concerns about prudent valuation. The Guidance is not intended to require Authorised Persons to change valuation procedures for financial reporting purposes.

4.

The Regulator will assess an Authorised Person's valuation procedures for consistency with the Guidance. The Regulator may impose a valuation adjustment if there is a material degree of inconsistency between the Authorised Person's valuation procedures and the Guidance.

CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE

Guidance

1.

This Chapter deals with all aspects of prudential requirements relating to the capital adequacy of Authorised Persons, in terms of both quantity and quality, and, where appropriate, the maintenance of liquid assets. (Chapter 9 covers more generally the related prudential topic of liquidity, the ability of an Authorised Person to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.) The Chapter outlines the minimum capital requirements that an Authorised Person should meet, consistent with Pillar 1 of the Basel Accord, and aims to ensure that an Authorised Person maintains adequate capital resources to support the risks associated with its activities and that it can fully absorb unexpected losses at any time. A summary of the minimum capital requirements is given in App 3.2.

2.

This Chapter also includes provisions forming part of the framework for the assessment by the Regulator, under Pillar 2 of the Basel Accord, of the capital adequacy of an Authorised Person, with further detail given in Chapter 10. The disclosure requirements placed upon an Authorised Person under Pillar 3 of the Basel Accord are covered in Chapter 11.

3.

Part 1 of this Chapter sets out the application provisions. Part 2 of this Chapter outlines the fundamental capital adequacy obligations and the systems and controls requirements to ensure compliance with this critical regulatory obligation. Part 3 of this Chapter and the related App4 include the Rules and associated guidance for the calculation of minimum Capital Requirement for different Categories of Authorised Persons. Additionally, this Part also includes requirements for the maintenance of liquid assets by firms subject to the Expenditure Based Capital Minimum. Part 4 of this Chapter
