The effect of Rules 4.15.5 and 4.15.6, when taken together, impose a binding upper limit of 25% of Tier 1 on the portion of a Large Exposure in the Non- Trading Book.

2.

Where, under exceptional circumstances, the portion of the Large Exposure arising in the Trading Book causes the aggregate limit of 25% to be exceeded the Authorised Person is obliged to notify the Regulator in order to agree remedial actions to resolve the breach at the earliest opportunity.

4.15.7

Subject to IFR Rule 5.4.16 an Authorised Person must ensure that the sum of its Large Exposures does not exceed 800% of its Tier 1.

Guidance

1.

Exposures can arise in the Non-Trading Book and in the Trading Book from Credit Risk (for example on loans and advances) Counterparty Risk (for example, on unsettled trades and on Derivative contracts) and from Issuer risk (for example, on holdings of equities and bonds).

2.

Some Derivatives contracts may result in an Authorised Person being exposed to an Issuer as well as the Derivatives Counterparty. For example, a Derivative referenced on a Security may result in an Exposure to the Counterparty, to the transaction and to the Issuer of the underlying Security.

3.

Examples of an Exposure are actual or potential claims on a Counterparty including contingent liabilities arising in the normal course of an Authorised Person's business.
