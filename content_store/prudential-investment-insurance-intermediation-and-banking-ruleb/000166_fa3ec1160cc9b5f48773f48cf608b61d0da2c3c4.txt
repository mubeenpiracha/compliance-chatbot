Add-on for credit derivatives

A4.6.44 All credit derivatives referencing the same entity may be offset fully to form an entity-

level effective notional amount:

𝐸𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑁𝑜𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑘

(𝐶𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡) = ∑ 𝛿𝑖 ∗ 𝑑𝑖 𝑖∈𝐸𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑘

(𝐶𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡) ∗ 𝑀𝐹𝑖

(𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒)

where i ε Entityk refers to trades of Entityk.

Guidance

The effect of this formula is that the effective notional for each entity is the sum of the trade-level adjusted notional amounts multiplied by the supervisory delta adjustments and the maturity factor.

A4.6.45 The add-on for all positions referencing the entity is determined in accordance with

the following formula:

𝐴𝑑𝑑𝑂𝑛(𝐸𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑘) = 𝑆𝐹𝑘

(𝐶𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡) ∗ 𝐸𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑁𝑜𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑘

(𝐶𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡)

where SFk is the supervisory factor for the credit asset class, determined in accordance with the table set out in A4.6.36.

A4.6.46 The cumulative add-on for the credit derivatives hedging set is determined in

accordance with the following formula:

Trade level adjusted notional – foreign exchange derivatives

A4.6.47 The adjusted notional of foreign exchange derivatives is defined as the notional of the foreign currency leg of the contract, converted to the domestic currency.

Guidance

If both legs of the foreign exchange derivative are denominated in currencies other than the domestic currency, the
