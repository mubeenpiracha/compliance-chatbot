4.14.24 Where CRM is applied to a specific Exposure within a securitisation the Authorised Person must treat the Exposure as unrated, and then use the mitigation as set out in Section 4.13 should the Rules contained in that Section apply.

4.14.25 An Authorised Person must not use an ECAI rating for risk weighting purposes where the assessment is at least partly based on unfunded support provided by the Authorised Person itself.

4.14.26 The treatment outlined in Rule 4.14.24 also applies to Exposures in the Authorised Person's Trading Book. An Authorised Person's Capital Requirement for such Exposures held in the Trading Book can be no less than the amount required under the Non-Trading Book.
