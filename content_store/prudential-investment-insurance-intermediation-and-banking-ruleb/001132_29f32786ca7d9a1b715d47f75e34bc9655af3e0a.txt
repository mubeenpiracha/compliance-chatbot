Unrestricted PSIAs and other Shari'a compliant products

17.

For the purposes of calculating cash outflows, Unrestricted PSIAs should be treated similarly to the relevant category of Deposits specified in the Table. The appropriate run-off factor for a PSIA will depend on the contractual withdrawal rights of the investment account holders and whether it is a retail or wholesale account.

18.

For commodity Murabaha transactions, a run-off factor of 100% should be applied to the balance of the Murabaha payable, if the remaining term of the contract does not exceed 30 days. If early withdrawal of the original amount is allowed at the discretion of the Authorised Person with no mark-up, then the applicable run-off factor will be the same as that for the relevant category of Deposit or Unrestricted PSIA under the Table.

Outstanding debt securities

19.

Issuers with an affiliated dealer or market-maker must include outstanding debt securities (unsecured and secured, term as well as short-term) with remaining maturities greater than thirty days in order to cover the potential repurchase of such outstanding securities.
