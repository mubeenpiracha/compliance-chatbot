liabilities

77.

Provisions may be general (against the whole of a given portfolio) or specific (against particular Exposures identified as bad or doubtful), or both. The Regulator expects contingent liabilities and anticipated losses to be recognised in accordance with the applicable accounting standards.

78.

Appropriate systems and controls for provisions vary with the nature, scale and complexity of the credit granted. An Authorised Person for which the extension of credit is a substantial part of its business is expected to have greater regard to developing, implementing and documenting a provisioning policy than an Authorised Person for which Credit Risk is incidental to the operation of its business.

79.

The Regulator recognises that the frequency with which an Authorised Person reviews its provisioning policy once it has been established will vary from firm to firm. However, the Regulator expects an Authorised Person to review its policy to ensure it remains appropriate for the business it undertakes and the economic environment in which it operates. The provisioning policy should be reviewed at least annually by the Governing Body.
