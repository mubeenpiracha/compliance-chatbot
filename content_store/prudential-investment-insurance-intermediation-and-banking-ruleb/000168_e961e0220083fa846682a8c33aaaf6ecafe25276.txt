The effective notional for each entity, calculated in accordance with the above formula, is the sum of the trade-level adjusted notional amounts multiplied by the supervisory delta adjustments and the maturity factor.

A4.6.53 The Authorised Person must calculate the add-on for all positions referencing entity k

and its effective notional in accordance with the following formula:

Add-on for commodity derivatives

A4.6.55 The Authorised Person must determine the effective notional value of a commodity derivative transaction in a commodity of a particular type listed in A4.6.34 in accordance with the following formula:
