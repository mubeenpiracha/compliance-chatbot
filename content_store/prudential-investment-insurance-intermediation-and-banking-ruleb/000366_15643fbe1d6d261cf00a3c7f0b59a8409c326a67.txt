4.12.12 The CRW for any CR Exposure in the bank asset class that does not have an external credit assessment by an ECAI must be the risk weight determined in accordance with the table in Rule 4.12.10 or the risk weight that is applicable to an CR Exposure to the central government of the jurisdiction in which the banking institution is incorporated or established, whichever is higher. If a short-term CR Exposure in the bank asset class with an issue-specific external credit assessment:

(b)

attracts a risk weight of 150%, then the Authorised Person must apply a risk weight of 150% to any unrated CR Exposure (whether long-term or short-term) to the same banking institution.
