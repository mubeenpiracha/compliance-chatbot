Gamma impact = ½ x Gamma x VU²

where VU = Variation of the underlying instrument of the Option;

(b)

VU must be calculated as follows:

(i)

for interest rate Options if the underlying instrument is a bond, the market value of the underlying instrument should be multiplied by the risk weights set out in Section 5.4 for the underlying instrument. An equivalent calculation should be carried out where the underlying instrument is an interest rate, again based on the assumed changes in the corresponding yield in Rule A6.2.16;
