Guidance

The risk percentages in the table above are designed to reflect the price sensitivity of the positions to changes in the interest rate.

Maturity Method

A6.2.17 Under the Maturity Method, the following steps must be carried out:

(a)

the maturity weighted position for each instrument must be calculated by multiplying the market value of each individual long or short net position by the appropriate risk percentage per the table in Rule A6.2.16;

(b)

the sum of the weighted long and the sum of the weighted short positions in each maturity band must be calculated;

(c)

these weighted long and short positions must be matched within a maturity band to give the total matched weighted position in the maturity band and the total unmatched weighted position which will be long or short in the maturity band;

(d)

the matched weighted positions in all maturity bands must be summed;

(e)

the unmatched weighted positions in all the maturity bands must then be matched within a zone leaving an unmatched position for the zone (which will either be short or long); and

PRU VER17.290725

(f)

the unmatched positions in each zone must be matched with the unmatched positions in other zones leaving the residual unmatched weighted position.

A6.2.18 The General Market Risk requirement for each currency must be calculated as the sum

of the following:

(a)

10% of the matched weighted positions in each maturity band;

(b)

40% of the matched weighted position in zone A;

(c)

30% of the matched weighted position in zones B and C;

(d)

40% of the matched weighted position between zones A and B, and between zones B and C;

(e)

100% of the matched weighted position between zones A and C; and

(f)

100% of the residual unmatched weighted positions.
