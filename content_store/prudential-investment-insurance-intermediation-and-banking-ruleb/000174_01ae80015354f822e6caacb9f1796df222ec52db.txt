 the default fund contributions of the member (DFi) are not split with regard to client and house sub-accounts, they must be allocated per sub-account according to the respective fraction the initial margin of that sub-account has in relation to the total initial margin posted by or for the account of the clearing member.

(2)

For derivatives, EADi is calculated as the bilateral trade exposure the QCCP has against clearing member i using the approach in Rule A4.6.14. All collateral held by a QCCP to which that QCCP has a legal claim in the event of default of a member or client, including default fund contributions of that member (DFi), is used to offset the exposure of the QCCP to that member or client, through inclusion in the potential future exposure multiplier in accordance with Rule A4.6.14.

(3)

For SFTs, EAD is equal to max(EBRMi – IMi – DFi; 0), where:

a.

EBRMi denotes the exposure value to clearing member i before risk mitigation. For the purposes of this calculation, variation margin that has been exchanged (before the margin called on the final margin call of that day) enters into the mark-to-market value of the transactions;

b.

IMi is the initial margin collateral posted by clearing member i with the QCCP;

c.

DFi is the prefunded default fund contribution by clearing member i that will be applied upon such clearing member's default, either along

with or immediately following such member's initial margin, to reduce the QCCP loss.

A4.9.17 An Authorised Person must next calculate the capital requirement for each clearing

member in accordance with the following formula:

𝐾𝐶𝑀𝑖 = max (𝐾𝐶𝐶𝑃 ∙ (

𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑓

𝐷𝐹𝑖 𝐷𝐹𝐶𝐶𝑃 + 𝐷𝐹𝐶𝑀

𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑓);10% ∗ 2% ∗ 𝐷𝐹𝑖

𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑓)

where:

KCMi = the capital requirement on the default fund contribution of clearing member i;

DFpref

CM = the total prefunded default fund contributions from clearing members;

DFCCP = the prefunded own resources of the CCP (e.g. contributed capital, retained earnings, etc.), which are contributed to the default waterfall, where these are junior or pari passu to prefunded member contributions; and

DFpref

i = the prefunded default fund contributions provided by clearing member i.

Guidance

1.

If the Regulator is not provided with a calculation of KCCP, DFpref CM and DFCCP or if the Regulator is not able to confirm those calculations, the treatment set out in Rule A4.9.18 shall apply to the calculation made by the relevant Authorised Person to the default fund of a QCCP.

2.

KCCP should be calculated on a quarterly basis at a minimum, although the Regulator may require more frequent calculations in case of material changes (such as the QCCP clearing a new product). If the Authorised Person or Regulator performed the calculations, it should make available to any other Authorised Person which acts as a clearing member sufficient aggregate information about the composition of the exposures of the QCCP to clearing members and information provided to the Authorised Person for the purposes of the calculation of KCCP, DFpref CM and DFCCP.

3.

Such information should be provided a least on a quarterly basis. KCCP and KCMi should be recalculated at least quarterly, and should also be recalculated when there are material changes to the number or exposure of cleared transactions or material changes to the financial resources of the QCCP.

Prefunded and unfunded contributions to the default fund of a Non-QCCP

A4.9.18 An Authorised Person must calculate Credit RWA for the exposures arising from its contributions to the default fund of a Non-QCCP in accordance with the following formula:

Credit RWA =
