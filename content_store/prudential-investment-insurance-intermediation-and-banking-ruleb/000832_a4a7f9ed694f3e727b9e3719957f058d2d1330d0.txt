Exposures to central counterparties

A4.9.1

This Section applies to exposures arising from Derivatives, SFTs and/or long settlement transactions that are cleared by a central counterparty (CCP). Exposures arising from the settlement of cash transactions (equities, fixed income, spot FX and spot commodities) are not subject to this Section.

A4.9.2

Authorised Persons must:

(a)

monitor all their exposures to CCPs; and must have adequate procedures for the regular reporting of information on those exposures to senior management and appropriate committee or committees of the management body; and

(b)

assess, through appropriate scenario analysis and stress testing, whether the level of capital held by the Authorised Person against exposures to a CCP is adequate.
