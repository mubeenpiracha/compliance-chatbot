estimates of income and expenditure and a forecast balance sheet;

(b)

measures to increase the CET1 Capital of the Authorised Person;

(c)

a plan and timeframe for the increase of CET1 Capital with the objective of restoring the Combined Buffer; and

(d)

any other information the Regulator might need in order to carry out its considerations referred to in Rule 3.19.10 effectively.

3.19.10 (1)

Following assessment, the Regulator will approve the capital conservation plan only if it considers that the plan, if implemented, would be reasonably likely to conserve or raise sufficient CET1 Capital to enable the Authorised Person to meet its Combined Buffer Requirement, within a period that the Regulator considers appropriate.

(2)

If the Regulator does not approve the capital conservation plan, the Regulator may require the Authorised Person to increase its CET1 Capital to meet the Combined Buffer Requirement, within a specified period of time. The Regulator may also impose more stringent restrictions on distributions than those imposed under Rule 3.19.3 where the capital conservation plan is not approved.
