Purpose of the IRAP

The IRAP is an internal process of an Authorised Person which enables it to identify, assess, aggregate and monitor its risks adequately. The objective of the IRAP is to develop a comprehensive and detailed risk profile for the firm. The IRAP should help the firm ensure that sound risk management systems are in place, address any weaknesses in its risk management framework, and maintain adequate internal capital and liquid financial resources relative to its risk profile and to meet its liquidity risk management needs.

An Authorised Person should ensure that the IRAP forms an integral part of the firm's risk management framework and decision-making processes. The IRAP should cover all activities of the Authorised Person and should be proportionate to the nature and complexity of the firm's activities.

The Authorised Person should be able to demonstrate to the Regulator that its internal risk assessment is comprehensive and adequate relative to the nature of risks posed by its business activities and its operating environment.
