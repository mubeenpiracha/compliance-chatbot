Trade level adjusted notional – foreign exchange derivatives

A4.6.47 The adjusted notional of foreign exchange derivatives is defined as the notional of the foreign currency leg of the contract, converted to the domestic currency.

Guidance

If both legs of the foreign exchange derivative are denominated in currencies other than the domestic currency, the notional amount of each leg is converted to the domestic currency and the leg with the larger domestic currency value is the adjusted notional amount.

Add-on for foreign exchange derivatives

A4.6.48 The effective notional for foreign exchange derivatives is calculated in accordance

with the following formula:

𝐸𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑁𝑜𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑗

(𝐹𝑋) = ∑ 𝛿𝑖 ∗ 𝑑𝑖 𝑖∈𝐻𝑆𝑗

(𝐹𝑋) ∗ 𝑀𝐹𝑖

(𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒)

where i ε HSj refers to trades of hedging set HSj

Guidance

The effective notional for each currency pair, given by the above formula, is the sum of the trade-level adjusted notional amounts multiplied by the supervisory delta adjustments and the maturity factor.

A4.6.49 The Authorised Person must calculate the hedging set level add-on in accordance with

the following formula:

(𝐹𝑋) = 𝑆𝐹𝑗

𝐴𝑑𝑑𝑂𝑛𝐻𝑆𝑗

(𝐹𝑋) ∗ |𝐸𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑁𝑜𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑗

(𝐹𝑋)|

A4.6.50 The Authorised Person must then aggregate the foreign exchange derivative add-on

across hedging sets by simple summation, as follows:

(𝐹𝑋) 𝐴𝑑𝑑𝑂𝑛(𝐹𝑋) = ∑𝐴𝑑𝑑𝑂𝑛𝐻𝑆𝑗

Trade level adjusted notional – equity and commodity derivatives

A4.6.51 For equity and commodity derivatives, the adjusted notional is defined as the product of the current price of one unit of the stock or commodity and the number of units referenced by the trade.

Add-on for equity derivatives

A4.6.52 The Authorised Person must determine the effective notional value of an equity derivative transaction referenced to an entity in accordance with the following formula:
