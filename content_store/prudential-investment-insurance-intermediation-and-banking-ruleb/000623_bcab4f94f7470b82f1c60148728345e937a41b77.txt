An Authorised Person in Category 1 or 5 must calculate its short-term liquidity by using the net cumulative maturity mismatch position separately for each means of funding used by the Authorised Person as a percentage of the means of funding in the sight-eight day time band as follows:

PSIAus net cumulative maturity mismatch % =

Net cumulative maturity mismatch x 100 Total PSIAus

Total Deposit liabilities net cumulative maturity mismatch % =

Net cumulative maturity mismatch x 100 Total Deposits

If an Authorised Person exceeds a net cumulative maturity mismatch limit of -15% in respect of any of the means of funding it must immediately inform the Regulator in writing and clearly explain what steps it will take to bring its liquidity position back within the limit.
