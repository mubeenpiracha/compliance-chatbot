As new techniques for Credit Risk management, monitoring and reporting are developed, the Authorised Person should ensure they are tested and evaluated before undue reliance is placed upon them.

Where the account officer for a credit (or customer relationship manager, branch manager or similar) moves on, the incoming officer should carry out a take-over review. The review should cover inter alia the credit-worthiness of the borrowers, the adequacy of the documentation, compliance with covenants, performance of each loan and the existence and value of any Collateral.
