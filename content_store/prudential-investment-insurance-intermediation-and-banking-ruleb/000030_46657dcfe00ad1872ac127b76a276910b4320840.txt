3.6A.5

(1)

Subject to (2), monthly payment volume for a Payment Account Provider must be calculated as the total value of Payment Transactions executed by the Authorised Person in its preceding financial year divided by twelve.

(2) Where the Authorised Person has not completed a full financial year following its authorisation, the monthly payment volume must be calculated using the value of realised Payment Transactions since its authorisation and the projections contained in its business plan for the remainder of the financial year, subject to any adjustments required by the Regulator.

Guidance

1.

Under Rules 3.6A.3(2) and 3.6A.5(2), the projections for the remainder of the year should be informed by the value of realised funds remitted or Payment Transactions, as appropriate, following the authorisation of the Authorised Person.

2.

The monthly payment volume should be split into tranches, with the first $10mn being assigned to the first tranche, the next $90mn to the second tranche and so on.

3.

The portion of the Variable Capital Requirement for each tranche is then calculated by multiplying the monthly payment volume in each tranche by the percentage factor associated with that tranche and then summing those portions to derive the overall Variable Capital Requirement.

Stored Value Providers

3.6A.6

(1)

Subject to (2), a Stored Value Provider must calculate its Variable Capital Requirement as 2.5% of the average daily outstanding Stored Value, calculated on the first Business Day of each calendar month and using the outstanding Stored Value at the end of each calendar day over the preceding six calendar months.

(2)

Where the Authorised Person has not completed six months of operations following its authorisation, the average daily outstanding Stored Value must be calculated using the daily outstanding Stored Value since its authorisation and the projections contained in its business plan for the remainder of the six-month period, subject to any adjustments required by the Regulator.

Guidance

Under (2), the projections for the remainder of the six-month period should be informed by the value of realised daily outstanding Stored Values following the authorisation of the Authorised Person.

Multiple activities under Providing Money Services

3.6A.7

(1)

Subject to (2), an Authorised Person undertaking more than one of the activities of being a Money Remitter, a Payment Account Provider and a Stored Value Issuer must calculate its Total Variable Capital Requirement by summing the Variable Capital Requirements calculated under Rules 3.6A.2, 3.6A.4 and 3.6A.6 as appropriate.

(2)

An Authorised Person acting as both a Money Remitter and a Payment Account Provider must calculate its overall Variable Capital Requirement for the related activities by adding together the monthly payment volumes for those activities and undertaking the calculation in Rule 3.6A.4.

Guidance

An example of the calculation of the Variable Capital Requirement follows for an Authorised Person acting at the same time as a Money Remitter and a Payment Account Provider, with monthly payment volumes of $90mn and $120mn respectively for these activities, i.e. a total monthly payment volume of $210mn.
