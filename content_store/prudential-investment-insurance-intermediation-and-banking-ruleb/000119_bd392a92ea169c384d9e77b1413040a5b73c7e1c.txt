The Regulator may designate an Authorised Person as a D-SIB whether it is a Domestic Firm or a Branch. However, the measures that apply to a D-SIB that is a Branch will be less extensive than those that apply to one that is a Domestic Firm. For example, while both may be subject to more intensive supervision, a D-SIB that is a Branch would not be subject to higher capital requirements as those in chapter 3 do not apply to a Branch as it is subject to the capital requirements of its Home State Regulator.
