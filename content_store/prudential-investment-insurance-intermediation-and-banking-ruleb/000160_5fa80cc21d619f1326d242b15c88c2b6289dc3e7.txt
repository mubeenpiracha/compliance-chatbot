A4.6.7

If assets involved in the transaction are to be delivered by the Authorised Person and the transaction remains unsettled:

E = max (CV-MV, 0).

Guidance

E is the price difference to which the Authorised Person is exposed, being the difference between the agreed settlement price for the debt instrument, equity, foreign currency or commodity in question and its current market value, where the difference could involve a loss for the firm.

Free delivery transactions

A4.6.8

An Authorised Person must calculate the Credit RWA in accordance with the table in Rule A4.6.11 for free delivery transactions in both the Trading and Non-Trading Book where it has:

(a)

delivered Securities or commodities before receiving payment;

(b)

paid for Securities or commodities before receiving the items purchased; or

(c)

entered into a foreign exchange contract undertaken in the spot market or contracted for forward settlement and has released funds to its Counterparty but has not yet received the funds in the other currency.

A4.6.9

If the settlement of the transaction is to be effected across a national border, Credit RWA needs to be calculated only when more than one business day has elapsed since the firm has made the relevant payment or delivery.

Guidance

In respect of free delivery transactions referred to in Rule A4.6.9, if the dates when two payment legs are made are the same according to the time zones where each payment is made, they are deemed to have been settled on the same day.

A4.6.10 For a free delivery transaction an Authorised Person must determine its exposure E

after the end of the first contractual payment or delivery date as follows:

(a) if an Authorised Person has delivered Securities or Commodities or foreign

exchange funds to a Counterparty and has not received payment:

E = CV due to the Authorised Person

(b) if an Authorised Person has made payment of CV to a Counterparty for

commodities or Securities and has not received them:

E = CV â€“ MV of the Securities, commodities or foreign exchange funds due to it

A4.6.11 The Credit RWA in respect of free delivery transactions are to be calculated in

accordance with the following table:
