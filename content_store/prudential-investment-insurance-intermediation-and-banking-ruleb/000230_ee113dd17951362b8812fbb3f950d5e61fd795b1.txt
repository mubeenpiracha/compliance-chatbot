Approval of other types of HQLA

A10.2.9

(1)

The Regulator may approve other types of assets (in addition to those specified in Rules A10.2.6 to A10.2.8) as being eligible to be included in the stock of HQLA for the purposes of the calculation of the LCR.

(2)

It must specify whether the assets are to be treated as Level 1 HQLA or Level 2A or 2B HQLA.

Other provisions relating to LCR calculation

A10.2.10 For the purpose of calculating the LCR, if an eligible asset within HQLA becomes ineligible (e.g. due to a rating downgrade), an Authorised Person is allowed to keep the asset in its stock of HQLA for an additional 30 calendar days to allow time to adjust its stock as needed or replace the asset.

A10.2.11 For the purpose of calculating a consolidated LCR for a Financial Group, where applicable, qualifying HQLA held to meet statutory liquidity requirements at a legal entity or sub-consolidated level may be included in the stock at the consolidated level only to the extent that the related risks are also reflected in the consolidated LCR. Any surplus of HQLA held at the legal entity can be included in the consolidated stock of HQLA only if those assets would also be freely available to the consolidated Parent entity in times of stress.

A10.2.12 An Authorised Person must be able to meet its liquidity needs in each currency in which
