Overlapping Exposures

4.14.45

(1)

Where an Authorised Person has two or more overlapping Exposures to a securitisation, the firm must, to the extent that the positions overlap, include in its calculation of Credit RWA amounts only the Exposure, or portion of the Exposure, producing the higher Credit RWA amounts.

(2)

For the purposes of (1), overlapping Exposures result where an Authorised Person provides two or more facilities (whether they are liquidity facilities or Credit Enhancements) in relation to a securitisation that can be drawn under various conditions with different triggers, with the result that the Authorised Person provides duplicate coverage to the underlying Exposures. The facilities provided by the Authorised Person may overlap since a draw on one facility may preclude (in part) a draw on the other facility.

(3)

Where the overlapping Exposures are subject to different conversion factors the Authorised Person must apply the higher of the conversion factors to the Exposure.
