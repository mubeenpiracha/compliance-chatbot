Guidance

1.

In complying with Rule 6.12.2, an Authorised Person should take out and maintain a contract for professional indemnity insurance (PII) from a reputable and well-capitalised Insurer and such contract should include cover in respect of claims for which the Authorised Person may be liable as a result of the conduct of itself and its Employees and appropriate cover in respect of legal costs arising from a claim.

2.

Pursuant to Rule 6.4.1(c), an Authorised Person should notify the Regulator of any significant PII claim made. What amounts to a significant claim will depend on the nature size and complexity of the Authorised Person and the Regulator would expect the Authorised Person to treat a series of small single claims which are significant in aggregate as significant for the purposes of Rule 6.4.1(c).

3.

An Authorised Person can fulfil the requirements under this Section by ensuring coverage of its activities under a group-wide PII policy, provided that policy covers the Authorised Person and its activities
