Guidance

1.

An Authorised Person's Credit Risk strategy should reflect the aim to achieve sound credit quality while at the same time ensuring profit and business growth. Therefore the Credit Risk strategy should address the Authorised Person's approach towards the decision on an acceptable level of risk/reward relationship, after taking into account resource and capital costs.

2.

An Authorised Person's Credit Risk strategy should allow for economic cycles and their effects on the credit portfolio during different stages of an economic cycle. For example, it should cater for a higher incidence of defaults in personal loan and credit card portfolios in times of economic recession.
