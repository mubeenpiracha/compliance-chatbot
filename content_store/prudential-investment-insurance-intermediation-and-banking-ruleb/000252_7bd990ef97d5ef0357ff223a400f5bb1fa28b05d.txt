Guidance

Exposures to banks with short-term credit assessments are not private sector credit exposures as they fall within the exempt asset class set out in Rule 3.18.5(e). However, exposures to non-bank entities with similar short-term credit assessments are private sector credit exposures for the purposes of Rule 3.18.5.
