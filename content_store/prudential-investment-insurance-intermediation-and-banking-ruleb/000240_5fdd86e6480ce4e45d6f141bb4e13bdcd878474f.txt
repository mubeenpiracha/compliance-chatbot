A10.4.15

In determining the residual maturity of both assets and off-balance sheet items that are to be included in the Required Stable Funding, an Authorised Person must calculate the residual maturity of each individual asset or off-balance sheet item as being that period up to the latest point in time to which investors have the right to extend the maturity of an asset or an off-balance sheet item.

Guidance

1. When determining the residual maturity of assets and off-balance sheet items, investors should be assumed to exercise any option to extend maturity. For assets with options exercisable at the discretion of the Authorised Person, the Regulator will take into account reputational factors that may limit the ability of the Authorised Person not to exercise the option. In particular, where the market expects certain assets to be extended in their maturity, Authorised Persons and the Regulator should assume such behaviour for the purpose of the NSFR and include these assets in the corresponding RSF category. For amortising loans, the portion that comes due within the one-year horizon may be considered as a having a residual maturity of less than one year and included in the appropriate RSF category.

A10.4.16 Subject to A10.4.17, an Authorised Person must calculate the Required Stable

Funding that it needs for its assets by:

(a)

assigning each asset to one of the RSF asset categories in the following table;

(b) multiplying the Carrying Value of each asset by the RSF factor associated with

that asset category; and

(c)

summing those weighted values.
