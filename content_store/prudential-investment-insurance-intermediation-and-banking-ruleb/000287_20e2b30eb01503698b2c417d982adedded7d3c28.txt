An Authorised Person's senior management or an appropriately delegated body (such as a credit committee) should be responsible for effectively implementing the Credit Risk strategy and policy approved by the Governing Body of the Authorised Person.

The appropriate level at which credit decisions are taken will vary according to the type of credit offered and the size and structure of the Authorised Person.

It will usually be appropriate for the final credit approval authority to be given by staff reporting independently from those staff interacting with clients.
