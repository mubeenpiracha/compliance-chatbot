Taking as Collateral large quantities of instruments issued by one obligor potentially creates Large Exposures and other concentration risks, e.g. sectoral or geographic. An Authorised Person should have a clearly defined policy with respect to the amount of those risks it is prepared to run. Such a policy might, for example, include a cap on the amount of Collateral it would be prepared to take from a particular Issuer or market. The Authorised Person should also take Collateral and purchased credit protection into account when assessing the potential concentrations in its overall credit profile.

Notwithstanding the presence of CRM considered for the purposes of calculating Credit RWA amounts, an Authorised Person should continue to undertake a full Credit Risk assessment of the underlying Exposure.

An Authorised Person must be able to satisfy the Regulator that it has systems in place to manage potential concentration of risk arising from its use of guarantees and Credit Derivatives.
