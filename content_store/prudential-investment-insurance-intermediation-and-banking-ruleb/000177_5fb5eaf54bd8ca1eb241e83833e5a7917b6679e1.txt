a.

the RWA amounts of the mezzanine securitisation positions held by the Originator in the securitisation do not exceed 50% of the RWA amounts of all mezzanine securitisation positions existing in this securitisation; and

b.

where in a given securitisation and the Originator can demonstrate that the Exposure value of the securitisation positions that would be subject to deduction from Capital Resources or a 1000% risk weight exceeds a reasonable estimate of the expected loss on the securitised Exposures by a substantial margin, the Originator does not hold more than 20% of the Exposures values of the securitisation positions that would be subject to deduction from Capital Resources or a 1000% risk weight.

there are no mezzanine securitisation positions
