A standard form Netting agreement is a form of agreement which is prepared by a reputable, internationally recognised industry association and is supported by its own legal opinion. Where additional clauses are added to a standard form Netting agreement, the Authorised Person should satisfy itself that the amended Netting agreement continues to meet the legal and contractual requirements in Rules 4.13.17 to 4.13.19.
