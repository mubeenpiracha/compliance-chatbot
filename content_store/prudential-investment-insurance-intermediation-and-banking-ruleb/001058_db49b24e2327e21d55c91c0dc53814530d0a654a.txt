With regard to the portfolio of all the positions incorporated in the model referred to in Guidance note 1, the Authorised Person should regularly apply a set of specific, predetermined stress scenarios. Such stress scenarios should examine the effects of stress to default rates, recovery rates, credit spreads, basis risk, correlations and other relevant risk factors on the correlation trading portfolio. The Authorised Person should apply stress scenarios at least weekly and report at least quarterly to the Regulator the results, including comparisons with the Authorised Person's Capital Requirement in accordance with this point. Any instances where the stress test results materially exceed the Capital Requirement for the correlation trading portfolio should be reported to the Regulator in a timely manner.
