 the value of the derivative transactions in the netting set (constituted in accordance with Rule A4.6.18); and

C = the haircut value of the net collateral held, calculated in accordance with Section A4.3.

A4.6.21 Derivative contracts with a one-way margining agreement in favour of the Authorised

Person's counterparty must be treated as unmargined transactions.

Net Independent Collateral Amount

A4.6.22 The independent collateral amount (ICA) is (i) collateral (other than variation margin) posted by the counterparty that is available to the Authorised Person on default of the counterparty; and/or (ii) the Independent Amount parameter as defined in standard industry documentation.

A4.6.23 The net independent collateral amount (NICA) is any ICA posted by the counterparty

less unsegregated collateral posted by the Authorised Person.

Calculation of RC for margined transactions

A4.6.24 RC for margined transactions is calculated in accordance with the following formula:

RC = max{V – C; TH + MTA – NICA; 0}

where:

V = the value of the derivative transactions in the netting set (constituted in

accordance with Rule A4.6.18);

C = the haircut value of the net collateral held, calculated in accordance with Section

A4.3;

TH = the positive threshold before the counterparty is required to send the Authorised

Person collateral;

MTA = the minimum transfer amount applicable to the counterparty;

NICA = the net independent collateral amount.

Guidance

(TH + MTA – NICA) represents the largest exposure that would not trigger a variation margin call. For example, without initial margin, the greatest exposure that would not trigger a variation call is the threshold plus any minimum transfer amount.

Potential Future Exposure

A4.6.25 The PFE consists of (i) an aggregate add-on component, which consists of add-ons calculated for each asset class and (ii) a multiplier that allows for the recognition of excess collateral or negative mark-to-market value for the transactions.

A4.6.26 PFE is calculated as follows:

PFE = multiplier * AddOnaggregate

where:

AddOnaggregate = the aggregate add-on component; and

292

PRU VER17.290725

multiplier = a function of three inputs (V, C and AddOnaggregate), calculated in accordance with Rule A4.6.27.

A4.6.27 The multiplier input is calculated in accordance with the following formula:

multiplier = min {1;𝐹𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑟 + (1 − 𝐹𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑟)∗exp(

𝑉−𝐶 2∗(1−𝐹𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑟)∗𝐴𝑑𝑑𝑂𝑛𝑎𝑔𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑒)}

where:

exp(…) = the exponential function;

Floor = 5%;

V = the value of the derivative transactions in the netting set; and

C = the haircut value of the net collateral held, calculated in accordance with Section

A4.3.

General steps for calculating the add-on

A4.6.28 For each transaction, the Authorised Person must identify the primary risk factor or factors and attribute the transaction to one or more of the five asset classes: interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity or commodity.

A4.6.29 The Authorised Person must determine the add-on for each asset class in accordance

with the asset-class-specific formulae set out in A4.6.35 – A4.6.58.

Guidance

Most derivative transactions have one primary risk driver, defined by the reference underlying instrument (e.g. an interest rate curve for an interest rate swap, a reference entity for a credit default swap, a foreign exchange rate for an FX call option etc.).

Formulae and parameters common to all asset classes
