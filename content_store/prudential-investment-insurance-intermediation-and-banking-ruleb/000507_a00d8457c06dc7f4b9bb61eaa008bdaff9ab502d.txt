Guidance

1.

This Chapter includes the detailed Rules and associated guidance in respect of a firm's obligation to manage effectively its Exposures to Operational Risk. Operational Risk refers to the risk of incurring losses due to the failure of systems, processes, and personnel to perform expected tasks. Operational Risk losses also include losses arising out of legal risk. This Chapter aims to ensure that an Authorised Person has a robust Operational Risk management framework commensurate with the nature, scale and complexity of its operations and that it holds sufficient regulatory capital against Operational Risk Exposures.
