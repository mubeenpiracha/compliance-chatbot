Step 1

A4.6.40 The effective notional is calculated in accordance with the following formula:

(𝐼𝑅) = ∑ 𝛿𝑖 ∗ 𝐷𝑗𝑘 𝑖∈(𝐶𝑐𝑦𝑗,𝑀𝐵𝑘)

(𝐼𝑅) ∗ 𝑀𝐹𝑖 𝑑𝑖

(𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒)

where:

i ε (Ccyj, MBk) refers to trades of currency j that belong to maturity bucket k.

Guidance

The effect of this formula is that the effective notional for each time bucket and currency is the sum of the trade-level adjusted notional amounts multiplied by the supervisory delta adjustments and the maturity factor.

Step 2

A4.6.41 The Authorised Person must aggregate across maturity buckets for each hedging set
