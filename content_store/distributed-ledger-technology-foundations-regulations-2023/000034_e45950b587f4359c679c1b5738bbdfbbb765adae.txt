Voidness of provisions protecting auditors from liability

98.

Voidness of provisions protecting auditors from liability

(1)

This section 98 applies to any provision:

(a)

for exempting an auditor of a DLT Foundation (to any extent) from any liability that would otherwise attach to him in connection with any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust in relation to the DLT Foundation occurring in the course of the audit of the Annual Accounts; or

(b)

by which a DLT Foundation directly or indirectly provides an indemnity (to any extent) for an auditor of the DLT Foundation, or of an associated DLT Foundation, against any liability attaching to him in connection with any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of

100.

(1)

(2)

101.

(1)

(2)

trust in relation to the DLT Foundation of which he is auditor occurring in the course of the audit of Annual Accounts.

Any such provision is void, except as permitted by:

(a)

section 99; or

(b)

sections 100 to 101.

This section applies to any provision, whether contained in a DLT Foundation’s articles or in any contract with the DLT Foundation or otherwise.

Indemnity for costs of successfully defending proceedings

Section 98 does not prevent a DLT Foundation from indemnifying an auditor against any liability incurred by him in defending proceedings (whether civil or criminal) in which judgment is given in his favour or he is acquitted.

Liability limitation agreements

A “liability limitation agreement” is an agreement that purports to limit the amount of liability owed to a DLT Foundation by its auditor in respect of any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust, occurring in the course of the audit of the Annual Accounts, of which the auditor may be guilty and found liable in relation to the DLT Foundation.

Section 98 does not affect the validity of a liability limitation agreement that:

(a)

complies with section 101;

(b)

complies with any rules made by the Board under section 101; and

(c)

is not incompatible with the requirements of section 102.

Terms of liability limitation agreement

A liability limitation agreement:

(a)

must not apply in respect of acts or omissions occurring in the course of the audit of the Annual Accounts for more than one financial year; and

(b)

must specify the financial year in relation to which it applies.

The Board may make rules:

(a)

requiring liability limitation agreements to contain specified provisions or provisions of a specified description; and

(b)

prohibiting liability limitation agreements from containing specified provisions or provisions of a specified description,

59

and “specified” here means specified in the rules.

(3)

Without prejudice to the generality of the power conferred by subsection (2), that power may be exercised with a view to preventing adverse effects on competition.

(4)

Subject to the preceding provisions of this section 101, it is immaterial how a liability limitation agreement is framed. In particular, the limit on the amount of the auditor’s liability need not be a sum of money, or a formula, specified in the agreement.

102.

Effect of liability limitation agreement

(1)

A liability limitation agreement is not effective to limit the auditor’s liability to less than such amount as is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of the case having regard (in particular) to:

(a)

the auditor’s responsibilities under this Part 12;

(b)

the nature and purpose of the auditor’s contractual obligations to the DLT Foundation; and

(c)

the professional standards expected of him.

(2)

A liability limitation agreement that purports to limit the auditor’s liability to less than the amount mentioned in subsection (1) shall have effect as if it limited his
