It does not apply to disclosure:

(a)

for the purpose of assisting a body designated by rules to monitor auditors;

(b)

with a view to the institution of, or otherwise for the purposes of, disciplinary proceedings relating to the performance by an accountant or auditor of his professional duties;

It does not apply to disclosure to a body exercising functions of a public nature under legislation in any jurisdiction outside the ADGM that appear to the authorised Person to be similar to his functions under section 59 for the purpose of enabling or assisting that body to exercise those functions.

In determining whether to disclose information to a body in accordance with subsection (5), the authorised Person must have regard to the following considerations:

(a)

whether the use which the body is likely to make of the information is sufficiently important to justify making the disclosure;

(b)

whether the body has adequate arrangements to prevent the information from being used or further disclosed other than:

(i)

for the purposes of carrying out the functions mentioned in that subsection (5), or

(ii)

for other purposes substantially similar to those for which information disclosed to the authorised Person could be used or further disclosed.

amend subsection (3) of that section by specifying a Person unless the Person exercises functions of a public nature (whether or not he exercises any other function);

(b)

amend subsection (4) of that section by adding or modifying a description of disclosure unless the purpose for which the disclosure is permitted is likely to facilitate the exercise of a function of a public nature; or

Liability for false or misleading statements in the Auditor’s Reports

A Councillor of a DLT Foundation is liable to compensate the DLT Foundation for any loss suffered by it as a result of:

(a)

any untrue or misleading statement in the Auditor’s Report, or

(b)

the omission from the Auditor’s Report of anything required to be included in it,

unless such Councillors proves that the Councillor acted honestly, with Reasonable Skill, Care and Diligence and that in the circumstances in which the activities were carried out the default was excusable.

No Person shall be subject to any liability to a Person other than the DLT Foundation resulting from reliance, by that Person or another, on information in the Auditor’s Report.

The reference in subsection (2), to a Person being subject to a liability includes a reference to another Person being entitled as against him to be granted any civil remedy or to rescind or repudiate an agreement.

This section 65 does not affect liability for a contravention of these Regulations or any other ADGM regulations.
