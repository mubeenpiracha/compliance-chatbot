(1)

Subject to sections 104, 105 and 106, Assets transferred to a DLT Foundation or otherwise vested in it shall be the Assets of the DLT Foundation with full legal and beneficial title and such Assets

are no longer the property of the Founder or Subsequent Transferor and are not the Assets of any Beneficiary (including a Tokenholder which is a Beneficiary) until such time as the Assets are distributed to such Beneficiary, if applicable, in accordance with the Charter or these Regulations.

(2)

A transfer or other disposition of property to a DLT Foundation registered under these Regulations shall not be void, voidable or liable to be set aside by reference to a foreign role of forced heirship or any other law of a foreign jurisdiction.

the transfer of property to the DLT Foundation or any term of its Charter contravenes any foreign statute, foreign requirement of heirship or foreign judicial or administrative order or action intended to recognise, protect, enforce or give effect to any such rights, claims or interest.

(5)

A judgement of a foreign court shall not be recognised or enforced insofar as it is inconsistent with subsections (3) or (4).
