A DLT Foundation’s financial year

The financial year of a DLT Foundation is determined as follows.

Its first financial year:

(a)

begins with the first day of its first accounting reference period; and

(b)

ends with the last day of that period or such other date, not more than seven days before or after the end of that period, as the Council may determine.

Subsequent financial years:

(a)

begin with the day immediately following the end of the DLT Foundation’s previous financial year; and

(b)

end with the last day of its next accounting reference period or such other date, not more than seven days before or after the end of that period, as the Council may determine.

Accounting reference periods and accounting reference date

A DLT Foundation’s accounting reference periods are determined according to its accounting reference date in each calendar year.

A DLT Foundation’s first accounting reference period is the period of more than six months, but not more than 18 months, beginning with the date of its registration and ending with its accounting reference date.

Its subsequent accounting reference periods are successive periods of twelve months beginning immediately after the end of the previous accounting reference period and ending with its accounting reference date.

This section 43 has effect subject to the provisions of section 44.

(a)

is to be shortened, so as to come to an end on the first occasion on which the new accounting reference date falls or fell after the beginning of the period; or

(b)

is to be extended, so as to come to an end on the second occasion on which that date falls or fell after the
