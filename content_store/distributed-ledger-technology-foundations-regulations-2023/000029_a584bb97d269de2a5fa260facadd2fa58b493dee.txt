Auditor’s Report

A DLT Foundation’s auditor must make a report to the DLT Foundation’s Council on all Annual Accounts of which copies are, during his tenure of office at the DLT Foundation, to be published under section 49 (the “Auditor’s Report”).

The Auditor’s Report must include:

(a)

an introduction identifying the Annual Accounts that are the subject of the audit and the financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation;

(b)

a description of the scope of the audit identifying the auditing standards in accordance with which the audit was conducted; and

(c)

include a reference to any matters to which the auditor wishes to draw attention by way of emphasis without qualifying the report.

The Auditor’s Report must state clearly whether, in the auditor’s opinion, the Annual Accounts:

(a)

fairly present:

(i)

in the case of a balance sheet, the state of affairs of the DLT Foundation as at the end of the financial year; and

(ii)

in the case of a profit and loss account, the profit or loss of the DLT Foundation for the financial year;

(b)

have been properly prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework and Accounting Standards; and

(c)

have been otherwise prepared in accordance with the requirements of these Regulations.

Expressions used in this section 77 that are defined for the purposes of Part 11 have the same meaning as in Part 11.

The auditor’s report must be either unqualified or qualified, for which purpose:

(a)

“qualified” means that the Auditor’s Report or statement does not state the auditor’s unqualified opinion that the Annual Accounts have been properly prepared in accordance with these Regulations or, in the case of an undertaking not required to prepare Annual Accounts in accordance with these Regulations, under any corresponding legislation under which it is required to prepare the Annual Accounts; and

(b)

if the Auditor's Report was qualified, the auditor must have stated in writing (either at the time of his report or subsequently) whether in his opinion the matters in respect of which his report is qualified are material for determining whether a distribution would contravene these Regulations.

Auditor’s Report

The auditor must state in the Auditor’s Report whether in his opinion the information given in the Auditor’s Report for the financial year for which the Annual Accounts are prepared is consistent with those Annual Accounts.

Duties of auditor

A DLT Foundation’s auditor, in preparing the Auditor’s Report, must carry out such investigations as will enable him to form an opinion as to:

(a)

whether adequate accounting records have been kept by the DLT Foundation and returns adequate for their audit have been received from branches not visited by him; and

(b)

whether the Annual Accounts are in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

If the auditor is of the opinion that:

(a)

adequate accounting records have not been kept, or that returns adequate for their audit have not been received from branches not visited by him; or

(b)

the Annual Accounts are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns,

the auditor shall state that fact in the Auditor’s Report.

If the auditor fails to obtain all the information and explanations which, to the best of his knowledge and belief, are necessary for the purposes of his audit, he shall state that fact in the Auditor’s Report.
