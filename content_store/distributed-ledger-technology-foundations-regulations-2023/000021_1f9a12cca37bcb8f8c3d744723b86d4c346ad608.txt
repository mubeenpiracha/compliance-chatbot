; or

(b)

three months from the date of the notice under this section 52,

whichever expires last.

If for any special reason the Registrar thinks fit, he may, on an application made before the expiry of the period otherwise allowed, by notice in writing to a DLT Foundation extend that period by such further period as may be specified in the notice.

Any such extension must not have the effect of extending the period for filing to more than twelve months after the end of the relevant accounting reference period.

In this section 52 “the relevant accounting reference period” means the accounting reference period by reference to which the financial year for the Annual Accounts in question was determined.

Calculation of period allowed

This section 53 applies for the purposes of calculating the period for filing the Annual Accounts and Auditor’s Reports which is expressed as a specified number of months from a specified date or after the end of a specified previous period.

Subject to the following provisions, the period ends with the date in the appropriate month corresponding to the specified date or the last day of the specified previous period:

(a)

if the specified date, or the last day of the specified previous period, is the last day of a month, the period ends with the last day of the appropriate month (whether or not that is the corresponding date); and

(b)

if:

i.

the specified date, or the last day of the specified previous period, is not the last day of a month but is the 29th or 30th; and

ii.

the appropriate month is February,

the period ends with the last day of February.

“The appropriate month” means the month that is the specified number of months after the month in which the specified date, or the end of the specified previous period falls.
