 in good faith for the purposes of performance and exercise of the functions and powers of the Registrar.

The Registrar shall maintain a public DLT Foundations Register established under these Regulations which will contain the following information in respect of each DLT Foundation:

(a)

name and registration number;

(b)

name and address in the ADGM of its Company Service Provider, if any;

(c)

name of each Councillor;

(d)

date of incorporation;

(e)

if applicable, date of continuation under these Regulations;

(f)

the scope of business activities under, and the expiry of, the commercial licence;

(g)

a copy of the Charter;

(h)

any information included in the Relevant Disclosure, provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Regulations, unless otherwise is expressly mandated by the Registrar, the names of the Beneficiaries (unless they are simultaneously Councillors, Founders, Beneficial Owners or Guardians) shall not be subject to public disclosure; and

(i)

copies of any Annual Accounts and Auditor’s Reports filed with the Registrar.

The DLT Foundations Register shall be in such form as the Registrar may determine.

The Registrar shall be entitled to, based on the application of a DLT Foundation, decide upon individual exceptions from the requirements of Part 11 and the requirements relating to the Relevant Disclosure, including the scope of disclosure or information to be included into Annual Accounts and the Relevant Disclosure.
