Resignation of auditor

An auditor of a DLT Foundation may resign his office by depositing a notice in writing to that effect at the DLT Foundation’s registered office.

The notice is not effective unless it is accompanied by the statement required by section 93.

An effective notice of resignation operates to bring the auditor’s term of office to an end as of the date on which the notice is deposited or on such later date as may be specified in it.

Notice to Registrar of resignation of auditor

Where an auditor resigns, the DLT Foundation must within 14 days of the deposit of a notice of resignation (“filing deadline”) send a copy of the notice to the Registrar.

Where a DLT Foundation defaults in complying with subsection (1) by the filing deadline, the DLT Foundation must pay a late filing fee up to the maximum amount prescribed in rules made by the Board.

Statement by auditor to be deposited with DLT Foundation

Where an auditor of a DLT Foundation ceases for any reason to hold office, he must deposit at the DLT Foundation’s registered office a statement of the circumstances connected with his ceasing to hold office, unless he considers that there are no circumstances in connection with his ceasing to hold office that need to be brought to the attention of Councillors or creditors of the DLT Foundation. If he considers that there are no circumstances in connection with his ceasing to hold office that need to be brought to the attention of the Councillors or creditors of the DLT Foundation, he must deposit at the DLT Foundation’s registered office a statement to that effect. The statement required by this section 93 must be deposited:

(a)

in the case of resignation, along with the notice of resignation;

(b)

in the case of failure to seek re-appointment, not less than 14 days before the end of the time allowed for next appointing an auditor; and

(c)

in any other case, not later than the end of the period of 14 days beginning with the date on which he ceases to hold office.

A Person ceasing to hold office as auditor who fails to comply with this section 93 commits a contravention of these Regulations. Where a contravention under this section 93 is committed by a Legal Person, any natural person acting for such Legal Person who is in default also commits the contravention.
