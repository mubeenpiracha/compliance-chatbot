 of these Regulations and for an order requiring the Councillors of the DLT Foundation to prepare revised Annual Accounts and Auditor’s Reports.

(2)

Notice of the application, together with a general statement of the matters at issue in the proceedings, shall be given by the applicant to the Registrar for registration.

(1)

(a)

the auditing of the Annual Accounts;

(b)

the revision of any Auditor’s Report; and

(c)

the taking of steps by the Councillors to bring the making of the order to the notice of Persons likely to rely on the previous Annual Accounts,

and such other matters as the Court thinks fit.

If the Court orders the preparation of a revised Auditor’s Report it may give directions as to:

(a)

the review of the Auditor’s Report by the auditors;

(b)

the taking of steps by the Councillors to bring the making of the order to the notice of Persons likely to rely on the previous Auditor’s Report; and

If the Court finds that the Annual Accounts or Auditor’s Reports did not comply with the requirements of these Regulations it may order that all or part of:

(a)

the costs of and incidental to the application; and

(b)

any reasonable expenses incurred by the DLT Foundation in connection with or in consequence of the preparation of revised Annual Accounts and Auditor’s Reports,

are to be borne by such of the Councillors as were party to the approval of the defective Annual Accounts and Auditor’s Reports and, for this purpose, every Councillor of the DLT Foundation at the time of the approval of the Annual Accounts and Auditor’s Reports shall be taken to have been a party to the approval unless he shows that he took all reasonable steps to prevent that approval.

Where the Court makes an order under subsection (5) it shall have regard to whether the Councillors’ party to the approval of the defective Annual Accounts and Auditor’s Reports knew or ought to have known that the Annual Accounts and Auditor’s Reports did not comply with the requirements of these Regulations, and it may exclude one or more Councillors from the order or order the payment of different amounts by different Councillors.

On the conclusion of proceedings on an application under this section 59, the applicant must send to the Registrar for registration a copy of the Court order or, as the case may be, give notice to the Registrar that the application has failed or been withdrawn.

The provisions of this section 59 apply equally to revised Annual Accounts and revised Auditor’s Reports, in which case they have effect as if the references to revised Annual Accounts and Auditor’s Reports were references to further revised Annual Accounts and Auditor’s Reports.

Other Persons authorised to apply to the Court

The Registrar may authorise for the purposes of section 59 any Person appearing to it:

(2)

(3)

(a)

to have an interest in, and to have satisfactory procedures directed to securing, compliance by DLT Foundations with the requirements of these Regulations relating to Annual Accounts and Auditor’s Reports;

(b)

to have satisfactory procedures for receiving and investigating complaints about the Annual Accounts and Auditor’s Reports; and

(c)

otherwise to be a Fit and Proper Person to be authorised.

A Person may be authorised generally or in respect of particular classes of case, and different Persons may be authorised in respect of different classes of case.

The Registrar may refuse to authorise a Person if it considers that his authorisation is unnecessary having regard to the fact that there are one or more other Persons who have been or are likely to be authorised.

If the authorised Person is an unincorporated association, proceedings brought in, or in connection with, the exercise of any function by the association as an authorised Person may be brought by or against the association in the name of a body corporate whose constitution provides for the establishment of the association.

An authorisation may contain such requirements or other provisions relating to the exercise of functions by the authorised Person as appear to the Registrar to be appropriate. No such authorisation is to be made unless it appears to the Registrar that the Person would, if authorised, exercise his functions as an authorised Person in accordance with
