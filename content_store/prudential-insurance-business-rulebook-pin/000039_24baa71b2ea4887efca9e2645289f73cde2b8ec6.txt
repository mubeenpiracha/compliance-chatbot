 Insurer's capital adequacy endangered. Systems should be adequate to prevent exposure to unacceptable, exceptionally volatile risks and to monitor transactions with a frequency commensurate with volatility and risk. The systems should trigger a hedge or close out a transaction whenever adverse movements or events threaten a significant worsening of the Insurer's capital adequacy position;

d.

have ensured that those who have responsibility for the control of instruments, are investments sufficiently independent of the day-to-day operators to ensure effective control;

in derivatives and other complex

e.

be capable of analysing and monitoring the risk of all transactions undertaken by the Insurer individually and in aggregate (including interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, fraud, error, unauthorised access to information and other operational risks);

f.

be provided regularly with appropriate statistics and information on the trading volumes of derivatives contracts by type of product including regular reports of all off-balance sheet transactions, contingencies and commitments;

g.

be satisfied that sufficient systems and controls relevant to derivative products and other complex investment instruments have been put in place, including independent agreement and reconciliation of positions, independent checking of prices, appropriate authorisation where dealing limits have been exceeded, etc; and

h.

have tested adequately and approved valuation models which are used to value open positions and derivative contracts, and other complex investment instruments, including controls preventing unauthorised programme amendments. Such models should include appropriate testing of the robustness of the portfolio in changing investment conditions, using realistic scenarios relevant to the circumstances of the Insurer.

10.

Stress and scenario testing should consider the impact of possible deteriorations in investment conditions, including where relevant the impact of simultaneous deteriorations in more than one market. It should also consider effects on liquidity, including where relevant those from an inability to repatriate assets from elsewhere. Where the insurance industry's holdings are large in relation to the turnover of the domestic market, scenario modelling should take account of the possible effect on the market of simultaneous liquidation of assets.

A2.7 Underwriting risk

Guidance

1.

Underwriting is the process by which an Insurer determines whether and under what conditions to accept a risk. Weaknesses in the systems and controls surrounding the underwriting process can expose an Insurer to the risk of unexpected losses which may threaten the capital adequacy of the Insurer.

2.

The risk management system for underwriting risk should normally include at least the following policies and procedures:

a.

clear identification and quantification of the Insurer's willingness and capacity to accept risk;

b.

clear identification of the classes and characteristics of insurance business that the Insurer is prepared to underwrite including:

i.

geographical areas;

ii.

the types of risk that may be underwritten; and

iii.

criteria for the use of policy exclusions and reinsurance;

c.

formal evaluation processes for the effective assessment of risks underwritten including:

i.

criteria for assessing risk;

ii.

methods for monitoring emerging experience; and

iii.

methods by which emerging experience is taken into account in updating the underwriting process;

d.

appropriate approval authorities and limits to those authorities that are definitive and specific (including controls surrounding any delegations that are given to intermediaries of the Insurer);

e.

concentration limits; and

f.

methods for monitoring compliance with underwriting policies and procedures such as:

i.

minimum standards of documentation;

ii.

internal audit;

iii.

peer review of policies underwritten;

iv.

assessments of brokers' procedures and systems to ensure the quality of information provided to the Insurer is of a suitable standard; and

in the case of reinsurers, audits of ceding companies to ensure that reinsurance assumed is in accordance with treaties in place.

a.

b.

make an assessment of the amount and incidence of the claim liability, including loss adjustment expenses; and

c.

manage the claim settlement process.

2.
