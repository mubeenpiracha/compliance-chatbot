48% of the amount of Adjusted Capital Resources, plus 100% of the amount by which the investment exposure exceeds 100% of Adjusted Capital Resources.

A4.8.4 If the amount included in the concentration risk component in respect of an investment exposure, aggregated with the sum of the amounts included in the default risk component, investment volatility risk component and off-balance sheet asset risk component in respect of the assets and off-balance sheet exposures comprising that investment exposure, exceeds 100% of that investment exposure, the concentration risk component in respect of that investment exposure must be reduced so that the total of the four components in respect of that investment exposure is equal to 100% of that investment exposure.

A4.9 Size factor component

Guidance

The effect of the size factor component is to provide a relatively higher capital requirement in respect of Insurers with smaller portfolios of Invested Assets. The calculation adjusts the aggregate of the default risk component, investment volatility risk component and concentration risk component in respect of Invested Assets, by a factor that varies according to the total size of Invested Assets.

A4.9.1 The base figure for the size factor component is determined by aggregating the following

components:

(a)

the default risk component determined in accordance with Rule A4.4, so far only as concerns the Insurer's Invested Assets;

(b)

the investment volatility risk component determined in accordance with Rule A4.5; and

(c)

the concentration risk component determined in accordance with Rule A4.8, so far only as concerns the Insurer's Invested Assets.

A4.9.2 An Insurer must calculate its size factor component by multiplying the base figure determined in accordance with Rule A4.9.1 by the factor derived by applying the following formula, where x represents the total Invested Assets expressed in millions of dollars:

(a)

If x ≤ 100, the factor is 1.5.

(b)

If 100 < x ≤ 200, the factor is (150 + 0.5(x-100))/x.

(c)

If 200 < x ≤ 1,200, the factor is (200 – 0.2(x-200))/x.

(d)

If x > 1,200, the factor is zero.

A4.10 Underwriting risk component

Guidance

The purpose of the underwriting risk component of the Minimum Capital Requirement is to require an Insurer to set aside capital to address the risk that the cost of claims in respect of General Insurance Business will vary from the cost implicit in the premiums being charged. The basic calculation model set out in Rule A4.10.2 applies different factors to the premium in respect of different Classes of Business, based on the different perceived risk of variability associated with each. The model is modified by additional provisions dealing with certain Classes of Business. This section also restricts the extent to which reinsurance may be taken into account when calculating the underwriting risk component.

A4.10.1 Subject to the other provisions of this section, an Insurer must calculate its underwriting risk component as the sum of the amounts obtained by multiplying the Insurer's base premium, for each Class of Business, by the percentage factors set out in the following table.
