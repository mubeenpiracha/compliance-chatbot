It is not the purpose of this appendix to provide guidance in areas that are common to many, if not all, Authorised Persons other than Insurers. The principal objective is to address areas that are of specific relevance to Insurers.

5.

The procedures set out in this appendix do not constitute a checklist of necessary procedures. An Insurer cannot assume that implementing all of the procedures set out in this appendix will guarantee that the Insurer complies with the requirements to which it is subject.

6.

Since this appendix is not intended to be prescriptive or exhaustive, it cannot be regarded as a substitute for reading the Rules themselves and taking professional advice. An Insurer should contact the Regulator if there are any areas which it would like to discuss further.

A2.2 Objectives of the rules

Guidance

1.

The objective of the Rules contained in Chapter 2 is that Insurers should control their own risks through sound and prudent risk management systems, such as to minimise the likelihood that events, internal or external to the Insurer, cause the Insurer to fail financially or operationally.

2.

The risk management systems required by the Rules should be integrated with the operational processes of a business. Insurers are expected to instil a strong risk control culture throughout their operations, so that material risks and potential problems that emerge can be identified, managed and promptly resolved in the normal course of business operations. The absence of such a control culture is likely to be taken as evidence that more specific control objectives are unlikely to be attained.

A2.3 Risk management systems

Guidance

1.

The Rules require an Insurer to develop, implement and maintain sound and prudent risk management systems, appropriate to the size, business mix and The responsibility for ensuring complexity of the compliance lies with the Governing Body and senior management of the Insurer.

Insurer's operations.

2.

The nature and extent of the systems and controls which an Insurer will need to maintain will depend upon a variety of factors including:

a.

the nature, size and complexity of its business;

b.

the diversity of its operations, including geographical diversity;

c.

the volume and size of its transactions; and

d.

the degree of risk associated with each area of its operations.

3.

To enable it to comply with its obligation to maintain appropriate systems and controls, an Insurer should regularly review its risk management policies in the

56

context of relevant environmental and operational factors and changes in those factors.

4.

The Rules lay down certain minimum processes and procedures that must be maintained by Insurers. These include a written risk management strategy, risk management policies and procedures, and allocated responsibilities and controls.

5.

The risk management strategy should cover not only the identification, assessment, control and monitoring of risks but also contingency plans to deal with the crystallisation of risks or adverse developments in important areas of risk. This will be assisted by stress and scenario testing tailored to the risk characteristics of the Insurer.

6.

While the risk management systems of an Insurer must address all material risks, Rule 2.3 lays down specific requirements for an Insurer to maintain risk management systems in respect of the following areas:

a.

balance sheet risk;

b.

credit quality risk;

c.

non-financial or operational risk;

d.

reinsurance risk; and

e.

Group risk.

7.

An Insurer should have regard to the need for adequate risk management systems at the level of any Group the Insurer is a member of (subject to exemptions for Groups that are intermediate Groups or Groups that are headed by Insurers, in which case the holding company is already subject to the risk management requirements in its own right). The Insurer bears a responsibility to take reasonable actions to ensure that the Group as a whole complies with the risk management requirements of the Rules. Although an Insurer may not be in a position to control the risk management systems of the Group, Group risk management systems are
