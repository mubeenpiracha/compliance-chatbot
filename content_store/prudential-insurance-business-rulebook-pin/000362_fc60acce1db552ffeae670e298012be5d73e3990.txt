Regulatory Returns for Cells, Long-Term Insurance Funds and ADGM business

Guidance

Separate Regulatory Returns are completed for Insurers' entire business, and for those parts of the business that are subject to separate capital adequacy requirements, namely Cells, Long-Term Insurance Funds, and ADGM business. These parts, and the entire business, are described as 'reporting units' because a Regulatory Return is required for each. An Insurer may therefore have to submit more than one set of Regulatory Returns.

A10.2.1 A Regulatory Return must be completed in respect of each of the reporting units set

out in this section that applies to the Insurer.

A10.2.2 There are four types of reporting units in respect of which an Insurer may be required to submit a Regulatory Return. These are referred to in this appendix and the forms as the global reporting unit, the Cell reporting unit, the fund reporting unit and ADGM business reporting unit. The Regulatory Returns in respect of these reporting units are referred to respectively in this appendix and the forms as the Global Return, the Cell Return, the Fund Return and ADGM Business Return.
