Guidance

1.

Because of Rule 5.6.7(c), no policy may be treated as an asset in the valuation and policies must be valued individually, unless they form part of a homogeneous group of contracts. This means an Insurer may treat groups of homogeneous contracts together and not breach the requirements in that Rule, provided that the valuation in respect of that group of homogeneous contracts does not collectively represent an asset. The onus is on the Insurer to demonstrate that the contracts represent a homogeneous group. In deciding whether to treat a group of contracts as homogeneous, an Insurer should consider whether the group would remain homogeneous under realistic scenarios to which the Insurer could be exposed.
