4.6

Availability of assets of Insurers incorporated outside ADGM

4.6.1 This section applies only to Insurers that are not ADGM Incorporated Insurers.

Guidance

The provisions in this section require an Insurer to have assets, of a minimum quality, available to meet its gross Insurance Liabilities arising from its ADGM Insurance Business plus a margin. Although the Insurer is required to cover its Insurance Liabilities gross of reinsurance, an Insurer still has benefit of its reinsurance arrangements because assets may include amounts receivable from reinsurers in respect of gross Insurance Liabilities, including amounts potentially receivable from reinsurers in respect of the exposures reflected in the Insurer's Premium Liability. No credit, however, may be taken in respect of a reinsurer that is Rated worse than BBB.

4.6.2 An Insurer that is not an ADGM Incorporated Insurer must always have assets, of a type referred to in Rule 4.6.3, that are available to meet Insurance Liabilities of the Insurer
