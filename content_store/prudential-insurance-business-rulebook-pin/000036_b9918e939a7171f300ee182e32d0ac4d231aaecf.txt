If the Regulator decides to exercise its power under (2), the Insurer may refer the matter to the Appeals Panel for review.

(4)

An Insurer must not effect any Contract of Insurance in Class 7(b) if the Regulator has objected to a proposal it has made under (1).

Guidance

The current requirements relating to Class 7(b) do not cater to monoline specialist financial guarantee insurers. However, if such an Insurer wishes to operate in ADGM, the Regulator may introduce requirements that should apply to such an Insurer. In doing so, the Regulator will consider capital adequacy and other requirements that apply generally to such specialist Insurers in other jurisdictions.
