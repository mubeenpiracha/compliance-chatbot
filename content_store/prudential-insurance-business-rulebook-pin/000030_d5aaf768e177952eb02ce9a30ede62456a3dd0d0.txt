If the Regulator withdraws an Insurer's permission to effect Contracts of Insurance in respect of the Insurer's entire Insurance Business or the entire Insurance Business of a Cell or Long-Term Insurance Fund, the Insurer must, within twenty-eight days of the written notice of withdrawal of permission (or, if later, the period specified in that notice), provide the Regulator with a written run-off plan in respect of that Insurance Business.

9.3.5 Where an Insurer's Insurance Business in run-off relates to a Cell or a Long-Term Insurance Fund of that Insurer, the run-off plan must deal with the matters set out in Rule 9.3.4 so far as they relate to that Cell or Long-Term Insurance Fund.

9.3.6 An Insurer that has provided a written run-off plan to the Regulator must monitor the matters contained in the run-off plan and must notify the Regulator promptly and in writing of any significant departure from the run-off plan.

Guidance

An Insurer should decide whether a matter constitutes a significant departure from a run-off plan, having regard to the nature and size of the matter and its materiality relative to the size and complexity of the Insurer and, where relevant, the size and complexity of the Cell or Long-Term Insurance Fund concerned. The following matters will normally be considered as representing a significant departure from a run-off plan:

a.

significant revision of the Insurer's strategy for managing risks, and in particular its strategy for the use of reinsurance;

b.

a significant deterioration in the Insurer's claims experience, financial position or solvency position (the amount by which the Insurer's capital resources, determined in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4 relevant to that

Insurer, exceed the applicable minimum capital requirements set out in that Chapter); or

c.

any other transaction or circumstance that is likely to have a material effect upon the Insurer's solvency position.
