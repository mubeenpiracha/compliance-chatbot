A5.8 Adjusted cellular equity

A5.8.1 An Insurer must calculate its adjusted cellular equity in respect of each Cell by adding items to and deducting them from the base cellular capital of that Cell, as set out in this section.

Guidance

The purpose of these adjustments is to provide a consistent basis for the determination of the Adjusted Cellular Capital Resources in respect of a Cell and to exclude from those resources assets that may not be readily realisable for the purposes of meeting any Cellular Liabilities of that Cell.

A5.8.2 The following items must be added to base cellular capital, to the extent that the Insurer

has excluded them in determining base cellular capital:

(a)

any minority interests in companies that are Subsidiaries of the Insurer, where the Insurer's interest in those companies constitutes a Cellular Asset of that Cell; and

(b)

any amount in respect of dividends to be paid by the Insurer in the form of Cell Shares of that Cell.

Long-Term Insurance Fund maintained by the Insurer.

A5.9.2 The amount of the non-cellular capital adjustment in respect of a Cell is an amount

selected by the Insurer, subject to the following constraints:
