APP9 CALCULATION OF ADGM BUSINESS RISK CAPITAL REQUIREMENT

A9.1 Purpose and general provisions

A9.1.1 This appendix applies to all Insurers to which Rule 4.6 applies.

Guidance

1.

This appendix sets out the manner in which an Insurer that is not an ADGM Incorporated Insurer is required to calculate its ADGM Business Risk Capital Requirement. The basis of calculation is analogous to the basis of calculation of elements of the Minimum Capital Requirement for Insurers that are not Cell Companies, as set out in APP4.

2.

The ADGM Business Risk Capital Requirement is calculated with reference to the insurance activities of the Insurer, carried out through its establishment in ADGM, without deduction for reinsurances.
