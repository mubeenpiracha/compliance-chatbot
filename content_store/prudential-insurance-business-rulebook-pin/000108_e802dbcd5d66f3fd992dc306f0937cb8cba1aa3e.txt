Guidance

Where information that would be contained in the Financial Group Capital Adequacy Report would be identical with information previously or concurrently provided to the Regulator pursuant to this or another provision of the Rulebook, and that information has not changed, the Regulator will normally accept a statement to that effect in the report in place of that information.

Introduction

Guidance

This Chapter requires an Insurer to provide the Regulator with a report by an Actuary in respect of its Insurance Liabilities and assets arising in respect of those liabilities (that is, assets which are contingent on the existence and amount of the liabilities, such as reinsurance, salvage and subrogation recoveries). Separate provisions apply in respect of reports on General Insurance Business and Long-Term Insurance Business.
