Company and where the Holding Company of the Group is another Insurer.

Guidance

1.

The effect of Rule 2.2.4 is to avoid unnecessary duplication arising from complex Group structures. If an Insurer is a member of a Group whose Holding Company is another Insurer, the first Insurer need not apply Rule 2.2.3 in respect of that Group, because the Insurer that is the Holding Company is already required to apply that Rule.

2.

An Insurer should describe how its risk limits, norms, and pricing policies described in Rule 2.2.1(d) link with its board approved risk appetite described in Rule 2.2.1(a), corporate objectives, business strategy and current circumstances. An Insurer is expected to incorporate its risk limits into its day-to-day operations and its risk management policies and procedures.
