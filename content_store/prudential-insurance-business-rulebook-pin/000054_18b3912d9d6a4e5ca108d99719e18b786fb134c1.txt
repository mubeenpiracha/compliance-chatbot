proportionate to the fraction of the contract period that falls into that reporting period, or on a different basis approved in writing by the Regulator.

A4.10.9 Where an Insurer enters as reinsurer into a finite risk reinsurance contract in respect of General Insurance Business, the underwriting risk component in respect of that contract, regardless of the Class of Business it relates to, must be 4% of the base premium on the contract.

A4.11 Reserving risk component

Guidance

The purpose of the reserving risk component of the Minimum Capital Requirement is to require an Insurer to set aside capital to address the risk that the cost of claims in respect of General Insurance Business will vary from the amounts recorded as liabilities in the Insurer's balance sheet. This calculation applies only to liabilities in respect of outstanding claims (the risk of deterioration in Premium Liability is addressed in the underwriting risk component in Rule A4.10). The principles of the calculation are similar to those in Rule A4.10.

A4.11.1 Subject to the other provisions of this section, an Insurer must calculate its reserving risk component as the sum of the amounts obtained by multiplying the Insurer's base claims reserve under Contracts of Insurance and reinsurance effected by it, for each Class of Business, by the percentage factors set out in the following table.

A4.11.2 Where an Insurer underwrites Contracts of Insurance in Class 1 or Class 2, and those contracts constitute Long-Term Insurance contracts, the Insurer must not calculate a reserving risk component in respect of those contracts but must instead calculate a Long-Term Insurance risk component as set out in Rule A4.12.

A4.11.3 The Regulator may, on written application by an Insurer undertaking Insurance Business in Class 2, give consent in writing to the use of percentages other than those stated in Rule A4.11.1(a), if the Regulator is satisfied that adequate mortality and morbidity information exists in respect of that business, to provide a reasonable basis for reliance on actuarial principles. The percentages that may be used must be those stated in the notice giving consent, but may not be lower than 5%.

A4.11.4 For the purposes of Rule A4.11.1, the Insurer's base claims reserve means the higher

of the following two amounts:

(a)

the amount of the Insurer's provision for Gross Outstanding Claims, less the amount of reinsurance and other recoveries expected to be received in respect of that liability; and

(b)

50% of the amount of the Insurer's provision for Gross Outstanding Claims.

A4.11.5 Where an Insurer has entered as reinsurer into a finite risk reinsurance contract, the reserving risk component in respect of that contract, regardless of the Class of Business it relates to, must be 6% of the base claims reserve on the contract.

A4.12 Long-term insurance risk component

Guidance

1.

The purpose of the Long-Term Insurance risk component of the Minimum Capital Requirement is to require an Insurer to set aside capital to address the risk that the net present value of future Policy Benefits will vary from the amounts recorded as Long-Term Insurance Liabilities in the Insurer's balance sheet.

2.

The calculation model set out in Rule A4.12.1 deals separately with Direct Long-Term Insurance Business, with proportional and non-proportional reinsurance of Long-Term Insurance Business, and with finite risk reinsurance of Long-Term Insurance Business.

3.

To determine the amount for proportional reinsurance business, the calculation model applies ratios to the Insurer's premium
