(d)

ordinary shares issued by an Insurer to a Holding Company whose own paid-up ordinary share capital, taken together with its general reserves, is lower than that of the Insurer.

A3.5.2 Subject to Rule A3.5.3, an Insurer must calculate its hybrid capital adjustment as the

amount by which the total amount of hybrid capital exceeds 15% of adjusted equity.

A3.5.3 The Regulator may at its discretion and on the application of an Insurer, permit that Insurer to apply Rule A3.5.2 as though the figure of 15% was replaced with a higher figure approved in writing by the Regulator. The approved figure may not be more than the actual percentage which the hybrid capital represents of adjusted equity, and may not in any case exceed 30%.
