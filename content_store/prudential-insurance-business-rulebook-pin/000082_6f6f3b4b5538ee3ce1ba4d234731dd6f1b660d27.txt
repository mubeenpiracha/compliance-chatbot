Guidance

1.

Where an Insurer's Insurance Business includes more than one Class of Business, the Insurer will normally be expected to establish payment profiles separately for each material Class of Business.

2.

Where the expected payment profile of assets or liabilities cannot be matched – for example, because the duration is too long – the Insurer should assume a discount rate regarded as consistent with the intention of this section.
