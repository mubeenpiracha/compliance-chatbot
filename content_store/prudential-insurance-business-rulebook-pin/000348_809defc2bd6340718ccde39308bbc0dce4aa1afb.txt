A8.7 Off-balance sheet liability risk component

Guidance

The purpose of the off-balance sheet liability risk component is to require an Insurer to set aside capital to cover the risk that it will be required to perform on a guarantee, letter of credit or other credit substitute that it has entered into. Although such items are not liabilities of the Insurer as at the Solvency Reference Date, they have the capacity to crystallise as liabilities at a subsequent date and therefore to affect the Insurer's capital position. The provisions in this section apply the relevant provisions of Rule A4.7 to each Long-Term Insurance Fund that an Insurer maintains.

A8.7.1 An Insurer must calculate an off-balance sheet liability risk component in respect of a Long-Term Insurance Fund if the Insurer has issued guarantees, including put options serving as guarantees, letters of credit or any other credit substitute in favour of another party, so that the Long-Term Insurance Fund is exposed to the risk of having to make payment on those instruments should the guaranteed party default.
