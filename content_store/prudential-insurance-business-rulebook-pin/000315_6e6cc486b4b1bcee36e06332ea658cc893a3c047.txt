A6.4 Default risk component

Guidance

The purpose of the default risk component is to require an Insurer to set aside capital to cover the risk that amounts receivable from counterparties will not be received. The basic calculation model for this component, as it applies to Insurers that are not Cell Companies, is set out in Rule A4.4. The provisions in this section apply this basic model to the segments of a Cell Company.

A6.4.1 An Insurer must calculate the default risk component in respect of a segment as the sum of the amounts obtained by multiplying the value of each asset of the segment with the relevant percentage, in accordance with the following tables and subject to the provisions of Rules A4.6.2 and A4.6.3:

(a)

assets that are Invested Assets: the table set out in Rule A4.4.1(a); and

(b)

assets that are not Invested Assets: the table set out in Rule A4.4.1(b).

A6.4.2 The provisions of Rules A4.4.2, A4.4.3, A4.4.4, A4.4.5, and A4.4.6 must be applied, mutatis mutandis, to assets of a segment as though references in those Rules to an Insurer were instead references to a segment.
