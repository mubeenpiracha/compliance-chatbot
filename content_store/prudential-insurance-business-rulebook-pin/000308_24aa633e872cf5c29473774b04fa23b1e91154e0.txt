The methods of calculation for the Minimum Non-Cellular Capital Requirement and the Minimum Cellular Capital Requirement in respect of a Cell are identical, so the term Minimum Segmental Capital Requirement is used to refer to both. Similarly, the term 'segment' is used in this appendix to refer to both a Cell and the non-cellular part of an Insurer.
