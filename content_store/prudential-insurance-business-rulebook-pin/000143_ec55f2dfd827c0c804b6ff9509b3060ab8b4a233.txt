1.

This Chapter sets out prudential provisions applying to Insurers that cease to carry on Insurance Business, either wholly or in respect of a particular Class of Business. The provisions are also applicable to Cells and Long-Term Insurance Funds of Insurers, but do not (because of the effect of Rule 9.1.2) apply to non-ADGM Insurance Business of Insurers that are not ADGM Incorporated Insurers.

2.

Rules 9.2 and 9.3 set out actions that an Insurer is required to take when it decides to cease to effect or carry out Contracts of Insurance. Rules 9.4, 9.5 and 9.6 give the Regulator specific powers relating to the supervision of such Insurers.

9.1.3 For the purposes of this Chapter, in determining whether an Insurer is effecting Contracts of Insurance, or has ceased effecting Contracts of Insurance, including Contracts of Insurance effected through a Cell or a Long-Term Insurance Fund, Contracts of Insurance effected under a term of an existing Contract of Insurance must be ignored.
