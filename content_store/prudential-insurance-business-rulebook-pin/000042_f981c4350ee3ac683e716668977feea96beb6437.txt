 limits are brought within the pre-approved limits within a set timeframe;

Disruptions may occur as a result of events such as power failure, denial of access to premises or work areas, systems failure (computers, data, building equipment), fire, fraud and loss of key staff.

2.

An Insurer's risk management system in respect of business continuity planning risk will normally be expected to include at least the following policies and procedures:

a.

processes for identifying:

i.

events that may lead to a disruption in business continuity;

ii.

the likelihood of those events occurring;

iii.

the processes most at risk; and

iv.

the consequences of those events.

b.

a business continuity plan (BCP) describing:

i.

procedures to be followed if business continuity problems arise;

ii.

detailed procedures for enacting the BCP, including manual processes, the activation of an off-site recovery site (if needed) and the person(s) responsible for activating the BCP;

iii.

a communications strategy and contact information for relevant staff, suppliers, (including exchanges), major clients, the media and other key people;

regulators, market authorities

iv.

a schedule of critical systems covered by the BCP and the timeframe for restoring these systems;

v.

procedures for backing up important data on a regular basis and storing the information off site.

A2.13 Outsourcing risk

Guidance

1.

Financial firms frequently decide to outsource aspects of their operations to other parties, Related or not. Outsourcing can bring significant benefits to a firm in terms of efficiency, cost reduction and risk management. However, both the process of implementing outsourcing arrangements and the outsourcing relationship itself may expose a firm to additional risk. It is therefore important

69

PIN VER07.290725

that firms take care to supervise the conduct of activities that are outsourced. GEN 3.3.32(1) requires an Authorised Person to inform the Regulator about any material outsourcing arrangement.

2.

The activities of outsource contractors have the ability to undermine the risk management activities of Insurers. Insurers should take particular care if outsourcing activities such as underwriting and claims management, where inappropriate performance of the functions can expose the Insurer to serious financial loss, for example through acceptance of inappropriate insurance risks, mis-pricing, failure to obtain appropriate reinsurance cover, or failure to detect invalid claims. These considerations apply to such arrangements as binding authorities and other agencies appointed by Insurers.

3.

In negotiating a contract with an outsource contractor or in assessing an existing agreement, an Insurer should give consideration to matters relevant to risk management, including the following:

a.

setting and monitoring of authority limits and referral requirements;

b.

the identification and assessment of performance targets;

c.

procedures for evaluation of performance against targets;

d.

provisions for remedial action;

e.

reporting requirements imposed on the outsource contractors (including both content and frequency of reports);

f.

the ability of the Insurer and its risk management functions (for example, internal auditors), and its external auditors, to obtain access to the outsource contractors and their records;

g.
