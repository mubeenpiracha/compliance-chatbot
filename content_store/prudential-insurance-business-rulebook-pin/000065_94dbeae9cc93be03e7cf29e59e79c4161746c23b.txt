 risk component as set out in Rule A6.5, as though the asset equivalent amount were a debt obligation due from the derivative counterparty.

A6.6.4 The asset equivalent amount in respect of a derivative is calculated as the sum of the current mark-to-market exposure of the derivative (where this is positive) and the amount obtained by multiplying the notional principal amount of the derivative by the factors specified in the table set out in Rule A4.6.4, according to the nature and residual maturity of the derivative.

A6.7 Off-balance sheet liability risk component

Guidance

The purpose of the off-balance sheet liability risk component is to require an Insurer to set aside capital to cover the risk that it will be required to perform on a guarantee, letter of credit or other credit substitute that it has entered into. Although such items are not liabilities of the Insurer as at the Solvency Reference Date, they have the capacity to crystallise as liabilities at a subsequent date and therefore to affect the Insurer's capital

position. The provisions in this section apply the relevant provisions of Rule A4.7 to the segments of a Cell Company.

A6.7.1 An Insurer must calculate an off-balance sheet liability risk component in respect of a segment if the Insurer has issued guarantees, including put options serving as guarantees, letters of credit or any other credit substitute (other than an insurance contract) in favour of another party, so that the segment is exposed to the risk of having to make payment on those instruments should the guaranteed party default.

A6.7.2 An Insurer must calculate its off-balance sheet risk component as the sum of the amounts obtained by applying the calculations set out in Rule A6.7.3 in respect of each guarantee, letter of credit or other credit substitute.

A6.7.3 The amount in respect of a guarantee, letter of credit or other credit substitute (other than an insurance contract) is obtained by calculating, for the nominal amount of the guarantee, letter of credit or other credit substitute, a default risk component as set out in Rule A6.4 and an investment volatility risk component as set out in Rule A6.5 in respect of the obligation or asset over which the guarantee, letter of credit or other credit substitute is written, as though that obligation or asset were an obligation or asset of the Insurer.

A6.8 Concentration risk component

Guidance

The purpose of the concentration risk component is to require an Insurer to set aside capital to cover the sensitivity that it has to default or volatility in respect of assets and exposures to single counterparties or groupings of connected counterparties, or single properties. The provisions in this section apply the relevant provisions of Rule A4.8 to the segments of a Cell Company.

A6.8.1 An Insurer is required to calculate a concentration risk component in respect of a segment if the segment has, as at the Solvency Reference Date, an investment exposure to a single counterparty or group of Related counterparties, or to a single property, that exceeds 10% of the adjusted segmental capital resources.

A6.8.2 For the purposes of the calculation referred to in Rule A6.8.1:

(a)

'investment exposure' means the aggregate value of all equity, bond or other investments in or in respect of the counterparty or group of Related parties or property in question, together with off-balance sheet exposures to the same counterparty or group of Related counterparties or property that the Insurer has because it has issued guarantees, letters of credit or other credit substitutes (other than insurance contracts), or because it has entered into derivative contracts, but excluding any assets excluded from base cellular capital or base non-cellular capital by reason of any of the Rules referred to in Rule A6.4.3(b);
