'adjusted segmental capital resources' in respect of a segment means Adjusted Cellular Capital Resources in respect of that segment (where the segment is a Cell) or the Insurer's Adjusted Non-Cellular Capital Resources (where the segment is not a Cell); and

A6.8.3 An Insurer must calculate its concentration risk component in respect of a segment as the sum of the amounts obtained by multiplying each investment exposure of that segment that exceeds 10% of the adjusted segmental capital resources, by the relevant factor percentage set out in the table set out in Rule A4.8.3, reading that table as though all references to Adjusted Capital Resources were references to adjusted segmental capital resources, and subject to Rule A4.8.4.

A6.8.4 If the concentration risk component in respect of an investment exposure of a segment, aggregated with the sum of the default risk, investment volatility risk and off-balance sheet asset risk components (so far as concerns that segment), in respect of the assets and off-balance sheet exposures comprising that investment exposure, exceeds 100% of that investment exposure, the concentration risk component in respect of that investment exposure must be reduced so that the total of the four components in respect of that investment exposure is equal to 100% of that investment exposure.

A6.9 Size factor component

Guidance

The effect of the size factor component is to provide a relatively higher capital requirement in respect of segments with smaller portfolios of Invested Assets. The provisions in this section apply the relevant provisions of Rule A4.9 to the segments of a Cell Company.

A6.9.1 The base figure for the size factor component is determined by aggregating the following

components, for the segment:

(a)

the default components determined in accordance with Rule A6.4;

(b)

the investment volatility risk component determined in accordance with Rule A6.5; and

(c)

the concentration risk component determined in accordance with Rule A6.8.

A6.9.2 An Insurer must calculate the size factor component in respect of a segment by multiplying the base figure for that segment as determined in accordance with Rule A6.9.1 by the factor derived by applying the following formula, where x represents the total Invested Assets of the segment, expressed in millions of dollars:

(a)

if x ≤ 100, the factor is 1.5;

(b)

if 100 < x ≤ 200, the factor is (150 + 0.5(x-100))/x;

(c)

if 200 < x ≤ 1,200, the factor is (200 – 0.2(x-200))/x; and

(d)

if x > 1,200, the factor is zero.

A6.10 Underwriting risk component

Guidance

1.

The purpose of the underwriting risk component is to require an Insurer to set aside capital to address the risk that the cost of claims will vary from the cost implicit in the premiums being charged. The provisions in this section apply the relevant provisions of Rule A4.10 to the segments of a Cell Company.

2.

As Insurance Business in Cell Companies may only be carried on through Cells, every Insurer will have an underwriting risk component of zero in respect of its Minimum Non-Cellular Capital Requirement.

A6.10.1 An Insurer must calculate the underwriting risk component in respect of a segment according to the method set out in Rule A4.10, applied as though all references in that Rule to an Insurer were instead references to that segment.

A6.11 Reserving risk component

Guidance

1.

The purpose of the reserving risk component is to require an Insurer to set aside capital to address the risk that the cost of claims will vary from the amounts recorded as liabilities in the Insurer's balance sheet. This calculation applies only to liabilities in respect of outstanding claims (the risk of deterioration in Premium Liability is addressed in the underwriting risk component in Rule A6.10). The provisions in this section apply the relevant provisions of Rule A4.11 to
