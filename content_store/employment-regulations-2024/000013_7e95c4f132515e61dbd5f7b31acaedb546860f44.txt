 end of service gratuity on the termination of their employment regardless of the reason for termination.

An Employee’s end of service gratuity shall be calculated as follows –

(a)

twenty-one (21) days' Basic Wage for each year of the first five (5) years of service with the Employer; and

(b)

thirty (30) days' Basic Wage for each additional year of service with the Employer.

For the purposes of calculating an Employee’s end of service gratuity –

(a)

the Employee’s Basic Wage shall be their Basic Wage at the Termination Date;

(b)

the daily rate of the Employee's Basic Wage shall be calculated by dividing the Employee’s Basic Wage by three hundred and sixty-five (365);

(c)

the Employee’s Basic Wage must not be less than fifty percent (50%) of the Employee’s Wages;

(d) where an Employee is employed under multiple successive fixed-term employment contracts, the Employee’s total period of service with the Employer must be used when determining their length of service; and

(e) where the Termination Date occurs part way through a year of service, the end of service gratuity for the part year of service must be calculated on a pro-rata basis.

The Employer may deduct from the end of service gratuity any amounts owed to the Employer by the Employee.

As an alternative to receiving an end of service gratuity under subsection (2), an Employer may give an Employee the option, in writing, of participating in a pension or savings scheme.

Where an Employee has received an option to participate in a pension or savings scheme in accordance with subsection (5), the Employee must confirm their choice in writing. If the Employee chooses to participate in the pension or savings scheme, they will not be entitled to any end of service gratuity under subsection (2) unless otherwise agreed by the Employer.

(a)

the Employee is a Remote Employee who does not reside in and does not perform work in the UAE;

(b)

the Employee obtains alternative employment or visa sponsorship in the UAE within thirty (30) calendar days of the cancellation of their Employee Work Permit; or

(c)

the Employee’s employment has been terminated by the Employer for cause in accordance with these Regulations.

An Employer may elect to either book an Employee’s repatriation flight directly or reimburse the Employee for the cost incurred in booking their own repatriation flight.
