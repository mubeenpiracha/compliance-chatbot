Payment in lieu of Vacation Leave

An Employee is not entitled to a payment in lieu of accrued but untaken Vacation Leave except on the termination of their employment and where otherwise agreed in writing by the Employer and Employee.

Where an Employee's employment is terminated, the Employer shall pay the Employee in lieu of Vacation Leave accrued but not taken by the Employee. In the event that the Employee has taken more Vacation Leave than they have accrued at the Termination Date, the Employer may deduct an amount calculated in accordance with subsection (3) from any payments due to the Employee on the Termination Date.

Payment in lieu of Vacation Leave shall be calculated using the Employee's Daily Wage at the Termination Date.

Dates on which leave is taken

Subject to subsection (2), an Employee must obtain their Employer’s consent before taking Vacation Leave, with such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

The Employer may require an Employee to take Vacation Leave on specified days in the current Vacation Leave Year by giving at least seven (7) calendar days’ prior written notice to the Employee.

Leave during the first year of employment

During the first year of an Employee’s employment, the amount of Vacation Leave the Employee may take at any time is limited to the amount of Vacation Leave accrued by the Employee at the time of taking the Vacation Leave.

Vacation Leave accrues during the Employee's first year of employment on a twelfth (1/12th) of the Employee’s annual entitlement monthly basis at the rate of one to Vacation Leave.
