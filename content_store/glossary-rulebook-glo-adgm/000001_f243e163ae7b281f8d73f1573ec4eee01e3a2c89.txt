Guidance

1.

Defined terms are identified throughout the Rulebook by the capitalisation of the initial letter of a word or of each word in a phrase. Unless the context otherwise requires, where capitalisation of the initial letter or letters of a word of phrase is not used, the word or phrase has its natural meaning.

2.

Many of the defined terms in GLO are used or defined in the relevant ADGM Regulations or Rules made under such Regulations. In these cases, GLO may refer to the provision in the Regulations and Rules which are the source of such a definition.

3.

Each Rulebook has a reference code of three or four letters, usually a contraction or abbreviation of its title (for example, COBS stands for the Conduct of Business Rulebook). The meaning of each of these codes is given in GLO.

4.

The singular form of Rule or Rulebook is used to identify each individual Rule or Rulebook, while the plural form refers to a collective set of Rules or Rulebooks, unless expressly stated otherwise.
