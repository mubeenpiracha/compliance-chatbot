Means the method of estimation of Petroleum Resources when the known geoscience, engineering, and economic data are used to generate a continuous range of estimates and their associated probabilities.

Has the meaning of the term or equivalent term in a Mining Reporting Standard.

Means those additional Petroleum Reserves which analysis of geoscience and engineering data indicate are less likely to be recovered than Proved Reserves but more certain to be recovered than Possible Reserves. It is equally likely that actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater than or less than the sum of the estimated Proved Reserves plus Probable Reserves (P2). When Probabilistic Methods are used, there should be at least a 50% probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the P2 estimate.
