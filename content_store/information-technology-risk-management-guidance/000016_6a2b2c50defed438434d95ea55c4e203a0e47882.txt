Third Party Contractual Agreements

3.2.6

A financial institution should ensure that the contractual agreement between it and a third party addresses any concerns highlighted during the due diligence in addition to provisions governing the products or services involved in the arrangement.

3.2.7

A financial institution should ensure that all third-party arrangements are governed by formal documented contracts that describe the terms, conditions, obligations, responsibilities, dispute management, rights and expectations of the contracting parties. Such contracts should be vetted on their legality and enforceability by a competent party.

3.2.8 Where a third-party engaged by the financial institution chooses to use sub-contractors to perform the contracted service, the third-party should ensure that the sub- contractors adhere to performance expectations and comply with regulatory obligations. The third-party should notify the financial institution of any changes in sub- contracting of the contracted service.

3.2.9

In particular, for the management of data risks, where the third party has access to, processes, or stores the financial institution’s customers’ data, the contractual agreement should have the necessary provisions to oblige the third party to comply with data protection regulations applicable to such data, and other applicable regulations.

Monitoring

3.2.10 The responsible individual or function within a financial institution should closely monitor the financial institution’s third-party arrangement(s) to ensure the third party meets expectations and the extent of monitoring should be commensurate with the nature, scope and complexity of the third-party arrangement. For example, monitoring can take the form of real-time monitoring of key metrics on service levels, regular reports provided by the third party on the performance of its product(s) or service(s), or meetings with the third party to resolve operational, risk management, or regulatory concerns.

3.2.11 As each third party is itself a live business entity that makes its own decisions on business strategy and risk management, financial institutions should not treat third parties as unchanging or static. Once entered into arrangements, a financial institution should conduct due diligence regularly to ensure that its third-party arrangements continue to remain relevant, effective and compliant. The regular due diligence performed on third parties should be reviewed and approved by an appropriate level of management.
