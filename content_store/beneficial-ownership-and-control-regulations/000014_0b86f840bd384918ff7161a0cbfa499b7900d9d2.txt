(1)

(a)

when the circumstances have arisen, and for so long as they continue to obtain; or

(b)

when the circumstances are within the control of the person having the rights,

but rights that are exercisable by an administrator, administration manager or by creditors while an ADGM Person or other legal entity is in relevant insolvency proceedings are not to be taken into account even while the person or other entity is in those proceedings.

For the purposes of subparagraph (1), an ADGM Person or other legal entity is in “relevant insolvency proceedings” if:

(a)

a liquidator (provisional or otherwise) has been appointed to act;

(b)

in the case of a trust, there has been a revocation of the trust; or

(f)

it is in proceedings under the insolvency law of another country or territory during which the entity’s assets and affairs are subject to the control or supervision of a third party or creditor.

Rights that are normally exercisable but are temporarily incapable of exercise are to continue to be taken into account.

Rights attached to shares held by way of security

Rights attached to shares held by way of security provided by a person are to be treated for the purposes of these Regulations as held by that person:

(b)

where the shares are held in connection with the granting of loans as part of normal business activities and apart from the right to exercise them for the purpose of preserving the value of the security, or of realising it, the rights are exercisable only in that person’s interests.
