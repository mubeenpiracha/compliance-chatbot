a.

the Listed Entity itself; or,

b.

whichever entity is designated by the Regulator as the Reporting Entity of that Listed Entity.

3.

An example of where the Regulator may designate an entity other than the Listed Entity to be the Reporting Entity is where “Company A” has issued a Debenture via a subsidiary securitisation vehicle “SPV X”. Whilst the Debentures of SPV X may be admitted to the Official List, making it a Listed Entity, it is unlikely to have the operational capacity to be a Reporting Entity in its own right. In such circumstances the Regulator will designate Company A as the Reporting Entity for the Debentures admitted to the Official List.

Therefore, any reference to a Reporting Entity in MKT should be read in the context applicable to a particular Listed Entity and any associated entities.
