Guidance

Rule 6.2.17 allows a Person who is acting as a Stabilisation Manager in respect of a dual- listing of Relevant Securities to rely on the Price Stabilisation Rules or on the laws of a Zone 1 jurisdiction to conduct those activities. The Rule is intended to provide Stabilisation Managers with some limited flexibility in respect of their activities in ADGM, so long as those activities are appropriately regulated.
