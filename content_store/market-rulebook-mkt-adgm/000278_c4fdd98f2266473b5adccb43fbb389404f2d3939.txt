Guidance

1.

Where a Person referred to in Rule 9.3.1 is required under any legislation applicable to such a Person to comply with a similar or more stringent requirement than the requirements in this section, compliance with those other requirements would be sufficient for the purposes of the relevant requirement in this section.

2.

For example, in the case of a reduction of Share capital, more stringent procedures such as a special resolution (i.e. a vote of at least 75% of the Shareholders in voting) may be required under the company law or other legislation applicable to a Listed Entity in its jurisdiction of incorporation. Where this is the case, compliance with the more stringent requirements applicable to the Listed Entity suffices for the purposes of compliance with the requirements in this section dealing with a Shareholder approval by simple majority in Rule 9.3.8.
