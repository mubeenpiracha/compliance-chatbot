Requirements applicable to new issues under Rule 9.7.1

9.7.2

In calculating the number of Equity Securities that a Listed Entity may issue or agree to issue under Rule 9.7.1 (including the number contributing to “Relevant Issues”), unless the Regulator determines otherwise, the following must be applied:

(1)

each fully paid Ordinary Security is counted as one;

(2)

each partly paid Security is counted as the maximum number of fully paid Ordinary Securities into which it can be paid up;

(3)

each Convertible Security is counted as the maximum number of fully paid Ordinary Securities into which it can be converted; and

(4)

in any other case, each Security is counted as the Regulator may decide, having regard to the need to ensure that holders of Ordinary Securities have an opportunity to vote on issues that may dilute their holdings or the characteristics of the Security.

9.7.3 When determining if there has been an issue of Equity Securities for the purposes of calculating the number of Relevant Issues, the sale or reissue of forfeited Equity Securities shall be treated as an issue of Equity Securities.
