Guidance

For the purposes of Rule 2.6.6(2) an example of a breach of the continuing obligations which may warrant a delisting by the Regulator would be where the percentage of Shares in public hands falls below the applicable thresholds set out in Rule 2.3.10(2). The Regulator may, however, allow a reasonable time to restore the percentage unless this is precluded by the need to maintain the smooth operation of the market or to protect investors.
