Restriction Formula

for Securities (non-Warrants)

The number of Securities not subject to a Restriction Period is calculated as (A / B) x C, where:

A = cash paid for the Securities that could be subject to a Restriction Period.

B = price set for the Securities in the Applicant at the time of admission to the Official List, or as otherwise determined by the Regulator.

C = the total number of Securities issued to the Person that could be subject to a Restriction Period.

for Warrants (which has the same terms as Warrants offered along with ordinary Securities), as part of an an linked offering application for admission to the Official List.
