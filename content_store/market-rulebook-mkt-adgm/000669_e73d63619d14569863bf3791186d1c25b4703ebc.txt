Over the last three financial years ended 31 December [year], [year] and [year], we have not declared and distributed dividends. We currently do not have a fixed dividend policy. Any future payment of dividends by us would depend on our earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors. If we do not pay any dividends, any return on investment may be limited to the value of our shares, and our shares may be less valuable because return on investment will depend entirely on capital appreciation.
