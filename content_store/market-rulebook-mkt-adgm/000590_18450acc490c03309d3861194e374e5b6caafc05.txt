All Directors should be subject to election by Shareholders at the first annual general meeting after their appointment, and to reelection thereafter at intervals of no more than three years. The Board should satisfy itself that there is adequate succession planning in respect of Board membership and the Senior Management, so as to ensure an orderly and smooth changeover of positions whilst maintaining an appropriate balance of skills and experience within the Reporting Entity and on the Board.
