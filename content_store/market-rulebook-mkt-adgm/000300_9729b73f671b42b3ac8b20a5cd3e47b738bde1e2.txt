Guidance

1.

A Person is regarded as exercising significant influence over a Listed Entity if, for example, that Person is a consultant or adviser or a shadow director of the Listed Entity. For the purposes of this guidance, “shadow director” means a Person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the Directors of the Listed Entity are accustomed to act.

2.

Any transactions between a subsidiary of a Listed Entity and a Related Party are included within the definition of a Related Party Transaction. This is because a Related Party may, through the Listed Entity, be able to influence terms which are more favourable to the Related Party when transacting with the subsidiary. Such transactions could be detrimental to the interests of the Listed Entity.
