Guidance

1.

A Person intending to apply to the Regulator for approval of a Fund Prospectus pursuant to Rule 3.3.1 should consider submitting a draft Prospectus for preliminary review by the Regulator prior to formally submitting the Prospectus for the Regulator's approval. See the GPM for procedures for applying for the Regulator's approval.

The approval of a Fund Prospectus by the Regulator will not prevent the use by the Regulator of its powers, such as the stop order power in section 71 of FSMR, in circumstances where the need for such action is subsequently identified. For example, if the Regulator becomes aware, after the approval of the Fund Prospectus, that it contains any false, misleading, or deceptive information, or if it breaches the Prospectus provisions in other respects, the Regulator may use its powers or take any other action as appropriate in the circumstances.
