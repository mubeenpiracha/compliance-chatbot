(d)

in the case of Non-CET1 Capital Instruments issued by an ADGM Parent Undertaking or ADGM Subsidiary of a Non-ADGM Financial Institution, and where those capital instruments are recognised for the purposes of meeting own funds or Capital Resource requirements on an individual and on a consolidated basis, the resolution authority of the Non-ADGM Financial Institution or, in the absence of a determination by the resolution authority of the Non-ADGM Financial Institution, the Regulator determines that unless the Write Down or Conversion Power is exercised in relation to those instruments, the Group would no longer be viable.

For the purposes of subsection (3), an Investment Firm is viable unlessâ€”

(a)

the Regulator is satisfied that the Investment Firm is failing or likely to fail (within the meaning of section 22); and

(b)

having regard to timing and other relevant circumstances, it is not reasonably likely that any action, apart from the write down or conversion of Non-CET1 Capital Instruments or the application of a Resolution Tool, will be taken by or in respect of the Investment Firm that will prevent the failure or likely failure of the Investment Firm.
