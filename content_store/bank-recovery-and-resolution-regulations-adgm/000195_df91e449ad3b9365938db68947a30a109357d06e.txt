recognition of, and taking action in support of, the Foreign Resolution Action (or the relevant part) would have material fiscal implications for the UAE or the ADGM.

The recognition of a Foreign Resolution Action (or any part of it) shall not prejudice any Insolvency Proceedings unless the Insolvency Proceedings conflict with the Recognised Foreign Resolution Action, in which case the Recognised Foreign Resolution Action shall take precedence.

Subject to section 27, where a Foreign Resolution Order has been made by the Regulator under this section which recognises a Foreign Resolution Action (or part of it), such Foreign Resolution Action (or part of it) shall produce the same legal effects in the ADGM as it would have produced had it been made under the law of the ADGM.

For the purposes of supporting, or giving full effect to, a Recognised Foreign Resolution Action, the Regulator may exercise one or more Resolution Tools, or one or more Resolution Powers, subject to any requirement for ex-ante judicial approval in compliance with section 27.
