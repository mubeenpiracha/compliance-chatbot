If the Regulator assesses that the measures proposed under subsection (2) do not effectively reduce or remove the impediments, the Regulator shallâ€”

(a)

subject to subsection (6), require the Institution and its Group to take alternative measures, including, without limitation, any measure specified in subsection (4) that may achieve that objective, and notify the Institution in writing of those measures and propose a plan to comply with them; and

(b)

explain to the Institution how the measures proposed by the Institution would not have adequately removed the impediments to resolvability and how the alternative measures are proportionate in removing them.
