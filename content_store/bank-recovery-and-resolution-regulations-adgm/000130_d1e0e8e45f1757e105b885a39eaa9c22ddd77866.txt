In exceptional circumstances, where the Bail-in Tool is applied, the Regulator may exclude or partially exclude certain liabilities from the application of the Write Down or Conversion Power whereâ€”

(a)

it is not possible to bail-in that liability within a reasonable time despite the reasonable efforts of the Regulator;

(b)

the exclusion is strictly necessary and is proportionate to achieve the continuity of Critical Functions and Core Business Lines in a manner that maintains the ability of the Institution in Resolution to continue key operations, services and transactions;

(c)

the exclusion is strictly necessary and proportionate to avoid giving rise to widespread contagion, in particular as regards Deposits and Eligible Deposits which would severely disrupt the functioning of financial markets, including financial market infrastructures, in a manner that could cause broader financial instability; or

(d)

the application of the Bail-in Tool to those liabilities would cause a destruction of value such that the losses borne by other creditors would be higher than if those liabilities were excluded from bail-in.
