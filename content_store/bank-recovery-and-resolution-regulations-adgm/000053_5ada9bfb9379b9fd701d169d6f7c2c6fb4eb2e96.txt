A Group shall be determined as resolvable if it is feasible and credible for the Regulator to Wind Up Group Entities under Insolvency Proceedings or to resolve Group Entities by applying a Resolution Tool to, and exercising Resolution Powers in respect of, the Group Entities while avoiding to the maximum extent possible any significant adverse effect on the financial system, including in circumstances of broader financial instability or system-wide events, with a view to ensuring the continuity of Critical Functions carried out by the Group Entities, where they can be easily separated in a timely manner or by other means.
