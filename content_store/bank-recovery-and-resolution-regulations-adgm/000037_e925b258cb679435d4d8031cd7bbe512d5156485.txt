Chapter 1 Recovery Plans

Individual Recovery Plans

The Regulator may require an Institution to prepare and submit to the Regulator for review an Individual Recovery Plan for the Institution. In exercising this discretion, the Regulator will consider the risk profile of the Institution and the impact of its failure on the financial system, market confidence or the economy in the ADGM or the reputation, integrity or public confidence in the stability of the ADGM.

The Individual Recovery Plan shall include the information set out in Part 1 of the Schedule and shall set out measures that would be taken by the Institution for the restoration of its financial position in the event of a significant deterioration of such financial position. The Regulator may require that additional information be included in the Individual Recovery Plan.

The Management of the Institution shall assess and approve the Individual Recovery Plan before submitting it to the Regulator.
