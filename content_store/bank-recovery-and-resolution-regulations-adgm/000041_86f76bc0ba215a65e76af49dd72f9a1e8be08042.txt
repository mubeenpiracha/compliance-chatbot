Assessment of Recovery Plans

The Regulator shall examine Recovery Plans submitted to it with a view to identifying any elements in the Recovery Plan which may adversely impact the resolvability or supervision of the Institution or Group.

In assessing a Recovery Plan, the Regulator may considerâ€”

(a)

whether the arrangements proposed in the Recovery Plan would, if implemented, be reasonably likely to maintain or restore the viability and financial position of the Institution;

(b)

whether the arrangements proposed in the Recovery Plan would be reasonably likely to be implemented quickly and effectively in situations of financial stress and, as far as possible, without any material adverse impact on the financial system of the ADGM;

(c)

any preparatory measures taken or planned to be taken by the Institution;

(d)

the possibility that the Recovery Plan may have to be implemented at the same time as Recovery Plans prepared by other Institutions; and

(e)

whether the capital and funding structure of the Institution is appropriate, having regard to the level of complexity of its organisational structure and its risk profile.
