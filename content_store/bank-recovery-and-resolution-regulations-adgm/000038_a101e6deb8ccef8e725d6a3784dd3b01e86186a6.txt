For Institutions forming part of a Group headed by a Non-ADGM Financial Institution, the Regulator may require disclosure of part or all of any existing Recovery Plans prepared at the Group level at the request of the supervisory authorities in jurisdictions other than the ADGM of any Group Entities. The Regulator may determine that such a disclosure satisfies the requirements under subsection (1).

Unless directed otherwise by the Regulator, Institutions required to prepare an Individual Recovery Plan under subsection (1) shall update their Individual Recovery Plans annually and after any change to their legal or organisational structure, business or financial situation, which could have a material effect on, or necessitate a change to, the Individual Recovery Plan.
