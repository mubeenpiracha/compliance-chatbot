Chapter 2 General Resolution Matters

Ex-ante judicial approval

A decision by the Regulator to take Resolution Action or make a Foreign Resolution Order shall be subject to it obtaining a prior judicial ruling from the Court in accordance with this section.

A judicial ruling in accordance with subsection (1) shall be mandatory prior to taking Resolution Action or making a Foreign Resolution Order, if the Resolution Action or Foreign Resolution Order amounts to or would amount to an action of confiscation or seizure or any restriction on individual ownership of funds, rights or activities under Article 19(1) of the ADGM Founding Law.

A judicial ruling may be requested from the Court by the Regulator in all other cases that do not fall under subparagraph (2).

Any application for a judicial ruling under this section shall be for a determination that the Regulator has reasonable grounds to conclude that the Resolution Conditions necessary for taking the Resolution Action or making a Foreign Resolution Order have been satisfied.
