(b)

the financial stability of the ADGM, including the prevention of contagion (including contagion to market infrastructures such as Recognised Investment Exchanges and Recognised Clearing Houses) and maintaining market discipline;

(c)

to ensure the continuity of the provision of Critical Functions in the ADGM;

(d)

the reduction of the risk to the public of financial loss due to the financial unsoundness of a person to whom these Regulations apply;
