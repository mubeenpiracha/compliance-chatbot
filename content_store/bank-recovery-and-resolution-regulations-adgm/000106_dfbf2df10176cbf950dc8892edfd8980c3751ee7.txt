Provisional Valuation

Subject to section 39, where the Regulator considers that the urgency of the case makes it appropriate for Resolution Action to be taken in respect of an In-Scope Entity before a Pre- Resolution Valuation can be carried out by an independent valuer appointed under section 35(2), the Regulator may cause a Provisional Valuation to be carried out of—

(a)

in the case of an In-Scope Entity that is not an ADGM Branch, the assets and liabilities of the In-Scope Entity; and

(b)

in the case of an ADGM Branch, the Business of the ADGM Branch.

Where a Provisional Valuation is carried out—

(a)

section 35(2) shall not be applicable to the Provisional Valuation;

(b)

the Regulator shall comply with section 35(4) and (5) so far as it is reasonable to do so in the circumstances;

(c)

the Provisional Valuation must make provision in respect of additional losses by the In-Scope Entity that are reasonably foreseeable; and

(d)

the Provisional Valuation shall be a valid basis on which a decision to exercise a Resolution Power may be taken.
