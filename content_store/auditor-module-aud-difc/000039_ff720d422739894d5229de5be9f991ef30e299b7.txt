(1) A request for withdrawal of registration by a Registered Auditor must be made by completing and submitting the appropriate form on the DFSA electronic portal to the DFSA.

the Registered Auditor has made appropriate arrangements with respect to its existing audit clients who are Relevant Persons; and

been resolved.
