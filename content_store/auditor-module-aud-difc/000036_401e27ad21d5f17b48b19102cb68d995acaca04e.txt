3. Under Article 98A(5) of the Regulatory Law, the DFSA may temporarily suspend the registration of a Registered Auditor or Audit Principal pending completion of an investigation against the Auditor or Audit Principal. The DFSA may only exercise this power where, arising from the investigation, it reasonably believes that the Person has engaged in serious misconduct that may form grounds for withdrawal of the Personâ€™s registration. This might be, for example, where there is evidence of fraud, theft or other dishonest conduct or a risk to Client Assets. As the investigation is ongoing, the DFSA would ordinarily expect not to publicise a temporary suspension under this power. But the DFSA retains discretion to publicise such a suspension in an individual case if it is appropriate to do so given the particular circumstances.
