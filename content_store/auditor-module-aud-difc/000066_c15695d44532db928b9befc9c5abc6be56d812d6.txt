Guidance

An Auditor is prohibited from acting as an Auditor for an Authorised Person, Public Listed Company or Domestic Fund if it is providing any of the services set out in Rule 5.2.1 to the Authorised Person, Public Listed Company or the Fund Manager, Trustee or member of a Governing Body of the Domestic Fund. This is because the provision of such non-audit services creates a risk of a fundamental conflict of interest that would potentially prevent the Auditor from carrying out Audit Services properly. However, Auditors should be aware that there may also be other types of non-audit services which can create a conflict of interest and that may need to be considered on a case by case basis under Article 99A(2)(a) and (b) of the Regulatory Law to determine whether such other non-audit services create a conflict of interest or lack of independence that affect its ability to provide Audit Services to the Authorised Person, Public Listed Company or Domestic Fund.
