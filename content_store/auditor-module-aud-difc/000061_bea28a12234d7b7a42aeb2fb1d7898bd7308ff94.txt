A Registered Auditor may be required to make its records of whistleblowing reports available to the DFSA for inspection.

6.

In addition to the requirements in these Rules, Article 68A of the Regulatory Law provides legal protection to a whistleblower who discloses information about suspected misconduct in good faith to a specified person, such as the Registered Auditor, the DFSA or other relevant authorities.

7.

The protection under the Regulatory Law applies to any person who makes such a disclosure. For example, the disclosure may be made by a person who is or has been an officer, employee or agent of a Registered Auditor, a Person who provides services or products to the Registered Auditor or a person who has no formal connection with the Registered Auditor.

8.

The protection under the Regulatory Law is from liability, dismissal or detriment for making that disclosure. However, it does not, for example, prevent a Registered Auditor from taking action against an employee for other legitimate reasons, such as if the employee has engaged in misconduct.
