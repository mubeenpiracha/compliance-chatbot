the transferee as a result of the order.

If any property or liability included in the order is governed by the law of any jurisdiction other than the Abu Dhabi Global Market, the Court may order the person concerned or the Fund concerned, if the transferee so requires, to take all necessary steps to secure that the transfer of the property or liability is fully effective under the law of that country or territory.

Property transferred as the result of an order under this section may, if the Court so directs, vest in the transferee free from any Charge which is (as a result of the scheme) to cease to have effect.

An order under this section which provides for the transfer of property is to be treated as an instrument of transfer for the purposes of any enactment requiring the delivery of an instrument of transfer to register property.
