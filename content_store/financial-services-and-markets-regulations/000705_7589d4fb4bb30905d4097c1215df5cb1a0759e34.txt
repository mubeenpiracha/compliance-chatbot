(1)

A contract is to be regarded as made for investment purposes if it is made or traded on a Recognised Investment Exchange, or is made otherwise than on a Recognised Investment Exchange but is expressed to be as traded on such an exchange or on the same terms as those on which an equivalent contract would be made on such an exchange.

A contract not falling within sub-paragraph (3) is to be regarded as made for commercial purposes if under the terms of the contract delivery is to be made within seven days, unless it can be shown that there existed an understanding that (notwithstanding the express terms of the contract) delivery would not be made within seven days.
