So far as necessary to enable the property to be applied in accordance with the rules of the Recognised Body or Remote Body, it may be so applied notwithstanding any prior equitable interest or right, or any right or remedy arising from a breach of fiduciary duty, unless the Recognised Body or Remote Body had received actual written notice of the interest, right or breach of duty at the time the property was provided as margin or as Default Fund Contribution. In order to be valid, any notice under this subsection may only be delivered to the Recognised Body or Remote Body by one of its members and must be delivered in accordance with or in order to satisfy applicable Rules made by the Regulator on Client Money in accordance with section 4, or similar rules in any Non-Abu Dhabi Global Market jurisdiction.119

No right or remedy arising subsequently to the property being provided as margin or as Default Fund Contribution may be enforced so as to prevent or interfere with the application of the property by the Recognised Body or Remote Body in accordance with its rules.
