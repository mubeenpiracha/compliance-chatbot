If a Document is produced in response to a requirement imposed under this Part, the person to whom it is produced may—

(a)

take copies or extracts from the Document; or

(b)

require the person producing the Document, or any Relevant Person, to provide an explanation of the Document.

If the person to whom a Document is so produced has reasonable grounds for believing—

141

(a)

that the Document may have to be produced for the purposes of any legal proceedings; and

(b)

that it might otherwise be unavailable for those purposes;

it may be retained until the proceedings are concluded.

If a person who is required under this Part to produce a Document fails to do so, the Regulator or an Investigator may require him to state, to the best of his knowledge and belief, where the Document is.
