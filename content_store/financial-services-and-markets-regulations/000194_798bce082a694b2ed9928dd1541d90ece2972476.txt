The imposition or variation of a Requirement takes effectâ€”

(a)

immediately, if the notice given states that that is the case;

(b)

on such date as may be specified in the notice; or

(c)

if no date is specified in the notice, when the matter to which the notice relates is no longer open to review.

(3)

The imposition or variation of a Requirement may be expressed to take effect immediately or on a specified date only if the Regulator, having regard to the grounds on which it is exercising its Own-Initiative Requirement Power, reasonably considers that it is

If the Regulator proposes to impose or vary a Requirement, or imposes or varies a Requirement with immediate effect, it must give A written notice.
