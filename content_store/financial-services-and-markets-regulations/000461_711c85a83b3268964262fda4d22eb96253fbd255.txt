255. Access to Regulator material

(1)

If the Regulator gives a person ("A") a notice to which this section applies, it must—

(a)

allow him access to the material on which it relied in making the decision which gave rise to the obligation to give the notice;

(b)

allow him access to any Secondary Material which, in the Regulator's opinion, might undermine that decision.

(2)

But the Regulator giving the notice does not have to allow A access to material under subsection (1) if the material is a Protected Item or it—

(a)

relates to a case involving a person other than A; and

(b)

was taken into account by the Regulator in A's case only for purposes of comparison with other cases.
