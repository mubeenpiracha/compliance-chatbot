The mere use of a source for prices and rates does not amount to delegation under these Rules. However, the use of a third party to carry out the pricing function, whether it is an Associate of the Fund Manager, or the Trustee or any Associate of the directors of the company or Persons providing the oversight function, or any independent third party, amounts to outsourcing. In this case the Fund Manager still retains its operating responsibilities and duties and, remains liable for the acts and omissions of that third party in performing the pricing functions as if they were the acts or omissions of the Fund Manager. The Fund Manager should ensure that the third party contracts to provide the service on a basis which takes account of the Fund Manager's responsibilities which require the Fund to be priced in accordance with the applicable Rules and the Fund's Constitution.
