Pricing controls by the Fund Manager

8.

Unit prices and currency rates used in Fund valuations should be up to date and from a reputable source. The mere use of a source for prices and rates does not amount to delegation under these Rules. Although it should not be necessary to carry out significant substantive checking, the reliability of the source of prices and rates should be kept under regular review, and the use of doubtful prices or rates should be followed up.
