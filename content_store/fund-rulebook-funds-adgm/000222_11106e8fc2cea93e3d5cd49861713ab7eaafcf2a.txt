Generally a firm will not be able to undertake mass marketing activities relating to Units of Exempt Funds because such marketing would not meet the Private Placement requirement, and would be likely to amount to a public offer, which can only be made in respect of a Unit of a Public Fund.

14.1.1

(1) A Fund may be classified as an Exempt Fund only if it fulfils the criteria in Rule 3.3.3 at the inception of the Fund and on an on-going basis.

(2) A Fund Manager must ensure that a Fund which is or is intended to be established and operated as an Exempt Fund meets the criteria in Rule 3.3.3 both at the inception of the Fund and on an on-going basis.

(3) For the purposes of (2), where a Fund Manager makes arrangements with other Authorised Persons or Persons in other jurisdictions to Offer to issue or sell the Units of an Exempt Fund, then it must take reasonable steps to ensure that those Authorised Persons or other Persons do not Offer to issue or sell the Units in a manner that would result in a breach of the criteria in Rule 3.3.3.
