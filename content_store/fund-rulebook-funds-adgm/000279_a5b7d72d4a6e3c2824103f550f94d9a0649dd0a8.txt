5. An asset should be subject to ongoing assessment to ensure it meets the criteria in Rule 20.3.3. For example, a green bond that fails to retain the positive opinion of a third party following its post-issuance review should be reassessed by the Fund Manager in terms of whether it can still be considered Eligible Climate Transition Fund Property. A Fund Manager should document its considerations regarding ongoing assessment of the appropriateness of classifying assets as Eligible Climate Transition Fund Property. The Fund Manager of an ADGM Climate Transition Fund must keep records of the due diligence process it has undertaken to assess whether an investment meets the Climate Transition Fund Investment Requirement at the time of acquisition and on an ongoing basis.
