(4) If any event occurs which may on reasonable grounds have a material effect on the valuation of the relevant property the Fund Manager must consult with the Valuer with a view to arranging a fresh valuation before any Units in the Fund are issued or redeemed after the date of the event.

(5) The Fund Manager must require that any valuation by the Valuer is on the basis of a 'market value' as defined in the Constitution and Prospectus.

Guidance

1.

A Fund Manager should consult with the oversight provider before appointing a Valuer.

2.

The Regulator would expect the Fund Manager to define 'market value' based on an authoritative text such as the current edition of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors' Appraisal and Valuation Standards ("Red Book") or similar practitioners text used by surveyors for the valuation to be a proper valuation under Rule 13.4.9(5).
