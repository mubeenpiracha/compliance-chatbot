Guidance

1.

In relation to Rule 10.1.5, copies of the Prospectus may be stored electronically so long as Clients and the Regulator have ready and immediate access.

2.

These disclosures should be provided at the inception of the fund or (as the case may be) before the relevant investor makes an investment in the Fund. A Fund Manager should also ensure that such disclosures are provided to its investors not only on a periodic basis, but as and when material changes occur.

3.

Should such a requirement conflict with any requirements that apply to a Foreign Fund in the jurisdiction in which the Fund is domiciled, the Authorised Fund Manager may apply to the Regulator for appropriate waivers or modifications of the Regulator requirements.
