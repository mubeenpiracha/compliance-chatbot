The principles do not apply to an individual in respect of any other functions he may carry out, although his conduct in those functions may be relevant to his fitness and propriety.

The onus will be on the Regulator to show that he is culpable, taking into account the standard of conduct required under the principle in question. In determining whether or not the particular conduct of an individual complies with the principles, the Regulator will take into account whether that conduct is consistent with the requirements and standards relevant to an individual's role and the information available to him.
