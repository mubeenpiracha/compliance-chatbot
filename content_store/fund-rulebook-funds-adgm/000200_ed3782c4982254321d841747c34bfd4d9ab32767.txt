Borrowing

13.4.7

(1) Subject to the Fund's Constitution and its most recent Prospectus, the Fund Manager, or the Eligible Custodian or Trustee on the instructions of the Fund Manager, may borrow money for the use of the Fund on terms that the borrowing is to be repayable out of the Fund Property.

(2) The Fund Manager must ensure, except in the case of a Property Fund, that the Fund's borrowing does not on any day exceed 20% of the gross asset value of the Fund Property and must take reasonable care to ensure that arrangements are in place that will enable borrowings to be repaid to ensure such compliance. The Fund Manager of a Public Property Fund may borrow either directly or through its Special Purpose Vehicle for financing investment, or operating purposes but aggregate borrowings must not at any time exceed 65% of the total gross asset value of the Fund.
