(b)

exercise the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person would exercise if he were in that person’s position;

(c)

act in the best interests of the Unitholders in the Fund and, if there is a conflict between the Unitholders’ interests and his own interests, give priority to the Unitholders’ interests;

(d)

not make improper use of his position, or information acquired in that position, in order to:

(i)

gain an improper advantage for himself or another person; or

(ii)

cause detriment to Unitholders in the Fund;

(e)

disclose to the Fund’s auditor any information relevant for the auditor to discharge its obligations;

(f)

comply with any other duty or obligation as the DFSA may prescribe under this Law or any other legislation administered by the DFSA, and

(2)

A person providing the oversight function for a Fund is to take all reasonable steps to assist the DFSA in exercising its powers under Part 5 of the Regulatory Law 2004.

(3)

Without limiting the application of any provision of this Law and any Rules made for the purposes of this Law, a person providing oversight function does not contravene any duty to which that person is subject where that person gives to the DFSA:

(a)

a notification as required under this chapter; or

(b)

any other information or opinion in relation to any such matter;

if the person is acting in good faith and reasonably believes that the notification, information or opinion is relevant to any functions of the DFSA.

Independence

(1)

A person providing the oversight function meets the independence criteria specified in Article 39(1)(b)(i) if, subject to Article 42(3), he:

(a)

is not, and has not been in the previous 2 years, an employee or an executive director or officer of the Fund Manager or a body corporate in the same group (a “related body corporate”);

23

(2)

(3)

(b)

is not, and has not been in the previous 2 years, involved in material business dealings, or in a professional capacity, with the Fund Manager or a related body corporate;

does not have a material interest in the Fund Manager or a related body corporate;

(e)

is not a relative or de facto spouse of a person who has a material interest in the Fund Manager or a related body corporate of a kind described in Article 42(1)(a) and to (d); and

(f)

if he is a person acting for the Trustee of the Fund where the latter is appointed for providing the oversight function, meets the independence criteria set out in Article 19 of the Investment Trust Law 2006.

A person does not cease to be independent for the purposes of this Article merely by virtue of being appointed as a person providing the oversight function for a Fund.

The DFSA may, by Rules, prescribe when a legal entity appointed as the person providing the oversight function to a Fund may or may not meet the independence criteria for the purposes of this Article.
