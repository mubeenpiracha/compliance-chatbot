PART 8: TRANSFER SCHEMES AND WINDING UP OF DOMESTIC FUNDS

59.

Application of this Part to Protected Cell Companies

(1) Where a Domestic Fund uses the form of a Protected Cell Company, the provisions in this Part also apply to individual cells of that company as if each cell were a separate Fund, except where otherwise provided in the Constitution or Prospectus of that Fund in accordance with this Law and any other laws that apply to such Funds.

(2)

The DFSA may, by Rules, prescribe any additional requirements or conditions that apply to such Funds.

60.

Transfer schemes

(1)

Pursuant to Part 9 of the Regulatory Law 2004, a Domestic Fund may be transferred in whole or in part to another body in accordance with that Part.

(2)

The DFSA may make Rules for the purposes of this Article pursuant to the power conferred under Article 113 of the Regulatory Law 2004.

61. When a Domestic Fund may be wound up

A Domestic Fund may be wound up:

(a)

by order of the Court as provided by or under this Law and the Insolvency Law 2004;

(b)

where not inconsistent with such Laws, in the manner and circumstances provided in the Fund’s Constitution; or

The Constitution of a Fund may provide that the Fund is to be wound up:

(a)

at a specified time; or

(b)

in specified circumstances or on the happening of a specified event;

but a provision of the Constitution that purports to provide that the Fund is to be wound up if a particular Authorised Firm ceases to be its Fund Manager or Trustee is of no effect including for the purposes of Article 65(1)(a).

63. Winding up at direction of Unitholders

If the Unitholders of a Fund want the Fund to be wound up, such persons may call an extraordinary meeting to pass a Special Resolution directing the Fund Manager or where appointed the Trustee to wind up the Fund.

The Fund Manager shall give to the Unitholders of the Fund and to the DFSA a notice in writing:

explaining the proposal to wind up the Fund, including explaining how the Fund’s purpose has been accomplished or why that purpose cannot be accomplished;

informing the Unitholders of their rights to call a Unitholders’ meeting to consider the proposed winding up of the Fund and to vote on any Special Resolution Unitholders propose about the winding up of the Fund; and

If no meeting is called within that 28 days to consider the proposed winding up, the Fund Manager or where appointed the Trustee may wind up the Fund.

in contravention of Part 8 of this Law, the Fund has not been registered with the DFSA or the DFSA has withdrawn the registration of the Fund;
