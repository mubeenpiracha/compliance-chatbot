the purpose or effect of the arrangements is to enable persons taking part in the arrangements (whether by becoming owners of the property or any part of it or otherwise) to participate in or receive profits or income arising from the acquisition, holding, management or disposal of the property or sums paid out of such profits or income;

(b)

the arrangements must be such that the persons who are to participate (“Unitholders”) in the arrangements do not have day-to-day control over the management of the property, whether or not they have the right to be consulted or to give directions; and

(i)

the contributions of the Unitholders and the profits or income out of which payments are to be made to them are pooled; or
