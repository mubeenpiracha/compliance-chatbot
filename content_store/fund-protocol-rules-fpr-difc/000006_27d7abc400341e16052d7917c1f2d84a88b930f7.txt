FPR is applicable to Fund Managers of Domestic Funds (as that term is defined in Rule 1.3.1) but also to other Authorised Firms that propose to carry on, or are carrying on, the marketing and selling of the Units of such Funds from the DIFC to potential investors and Clients situated in the ADGM or the State, outside the DIFC. It will also be relevant to Fund Managers, their Agents and any other Licensed Persons domiciled outside the DIFC that propose to carry on the marketing and selling of the Units of Domestic Funds to potential investors and Clients situated in the DIFC. However, where a Fund Manager or any other Authorised Firm only carries on Financial Services involving the Units of Domestic Funds with or for potential investors and Clients situated within the DIFC, then the Rules in FPR will not be relevant.
