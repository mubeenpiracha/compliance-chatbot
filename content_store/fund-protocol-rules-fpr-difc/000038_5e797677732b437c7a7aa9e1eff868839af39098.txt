If, at any time between the notification under Rule 3.2.2 and the commencement of Promotion in a Host Jurisdiction, the Fund Manager becomes aware of any material change, error, or omission reasonably likely to be relevant to such notification, the Fund Manager must give written notice to the DFSA without delay. The DFSA will promptly provide the relevant Host Regulator with all relevant details of the material change, error or omission.

If, as a result of any material change, error, or omission referred to in Rule 3.2.9, the Fund Manager will no longer comply with applicable legislation, including these Rules, or if the DFSA otherwise considers it necessary in the circumstances, the DFSA shall take all due measures, including, if necessary, the de-registration of the Public Fund from the DFSA's Register of Passported Funds in accordance with these Rules.
