PASSPORTED FUNDS

Passported Funds

This section applies if the DIFC is the Home Jurisdiction or Host Jurisdiction of a Passported Fund.

A Domestic Fund that is registered as a Passported Fund in accordance with these Rules must be either a Public Fund or a Private Fund.

If a Passported Fund is a Private Fund, the Fund Manager, its Agent and any other Licensed Person may Promote the Units in the Fund only by way of private placement to Qualified Investors and if the initial subscription is not less than $50,000 (or its equivalent in another currency).

If a Passported Fund is a Public Fund, the Fund Manager, its Agent and any other Licensed Person may Promote the Units in the Fund to Retail Investors and Qualified Investors.
