If, at any time between the notification under Rule 3.1.2 and the commencement of Promotion in a Host Jurisdiction, the Fund Manager becomes aware of any material change, error, or omission reasonably likely to be relevant to such notification, the Fund Manager must give written notice to the DFSA without delay. The DFSA will promptly provide the relevant Host Regulator with all relevant details of such material change, error or omission.
