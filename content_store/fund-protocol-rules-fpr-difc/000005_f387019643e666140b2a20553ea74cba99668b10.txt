Guidance

1.

The three UAE securities regulators: the SCA, the DFSA and the FSRA have agreed a “Protocol” regarding co-ordinated supervision of the marketing and selling of units of domestic funds within the UAE (State). The “Protocol” introduces a notification and registration process to enhance the monitoring and supervision of the financial services associated with the marketing and sale of units in domestic funds. The Protocol sets out a common regulatory framework which is to be implemented by each of the regulators. The Protocol is implemented in the DFSA Rulebook primarily through this module (FPR).

2.

FPR specifies procedures and requirements that apply in relation to a Passported Fund where the DFSA is either the Home Regulator or the Host Regulator of the Fund.
