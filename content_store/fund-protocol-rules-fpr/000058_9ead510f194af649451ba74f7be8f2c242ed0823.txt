The Rules in this module do not require an additional Prospectus to be made available for a Public Fund that is domiciled in the DIFC. If the Fund has a Prospectus that complies with the Rules in CIR, a Fund Manager would comply with A1.1.2 if it amends its Prospectus so as to include the additional minimum content required under this Rule that is not required under CIR.

The Prospectus for a Passported Fund must be made available in English. The Key Investor Information Document (KIID) referred to in the table in A1.1.2 must be made available in both English and Arabic.
