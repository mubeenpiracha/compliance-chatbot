Promotion by Fund Managers, Agents and other Licensed Persons

This section applies if the DIFC is the Host Jurisdiction of a Passported Fund.

The Fund Manager, its Agent and any other Licensed Person established or domiciled in another Jurisdiction, may Promote a Passported Fund in the DIFC without the need for further authorisation or approval by the DFSA, provided that such Promotion activities are limited to the Passported Fund and the DIFC is nominated as a Host Jurisdiction on the relevant Registers of Passported Funds.

In performing any activities in connection with the Promotion of a Passported Fund in the DIFC, the Fund Manager, its Agent and any other Licensed Person must comply at all times with the legislation applicable to them in the Jurisdiction in which they are domiciled.
