 knows that he has no authority or does not know or believe him to be a member of the limited liability partnership.

(3) Where a person has ceased to be a member of a limited liability partnership, the former member is to be regarded (in relation to any person dealing with the limited liability partnership) as still being a member of the limited liability partnership unless:

(a)

the person has notice that the former member has ceased to be a member of the limited liability partnership, or

(b)

notice that the former member has ceased to be a member of the limited liability partnership has been delivered to the Registrar.

(4) Where a member of a limited liability partnership is liable to any person (other than another member of the limited liability partnership) as a result of that member's wrongful act or

Ex-members

This section applies where a member of a limited liability partnership has either ceased to be a member or:

(a)

has died,

(b)

has been wound up, or

(c)

has assigned the whole or any part of his share in the limited liability partnership (absolutely or by way of charge or security).

In such an event the former member or:

(a)

his personal representative,

(b)

his liquidator, or

(c)

his assignee,

may not interfere in the management or administration of any business or affairs of the limited liability partnership.

But subsection (2) does not affect any right to receive an amount from the limited liability partnership in that event.

Designated members

If the incorporation document specifies who are to be designated members:

(a)

they are designated members on incorporation, and

(b)

any member may become a designated member by and in accordance with an agreement with the other members,

and a member may cease to be a designated member in accordance with an agreement with the other members.

But if there would otherwise be no designated members, or only one, every member is a designated member.

If the incorporation document states that every person who from time to time is a member of the limited liability partnership is a designated member, every member is a designated member.

A limited liability partnership may at any time deliver to the Registrar:

(a)

notice that specified members are to be designated members, or

(b)

notice that every person who from time to time is a member of the limited liability partnership is a designated member,

and, once it is delivered, subsection (1) (apart from paragraph (a)) and subsection (2), or

6

subsection (3), shall have effect as if that were stated in the incorporation document.

(5)

A person ceases to be a designated member if he ceases to be a member.

Registration of membership changes2

(1)

A limited liability partnership must ensure that:

(a)

where a person becomes or ceases to be a member or designated member, notice is delivered to the Registrar within 14 days, and

(b)

where there is any change in the particulars contained in its register of members or its register of members' residential addresses, notice is delivered to the Registrar within 14 days.

(2) Where all the members from time to time of a limited liability partnership are designated members, subsection (1)(a) does not require notice that a person has become or ceased to be a designated member as well as a member.

(3)

A notice delivered under subsection (1) that relates to a person becoming a member or designated member must contain:

(a)

a statement that the member or designated member consents to acting in that capacity, and

(b)

in the case of a person becoming a member, a statement of the particulars of the new member that are required to be included in the limited liability partnership's register of members and its register of residential addresses.

(4) Where:

(a)

a limited liability partnership gives notice of a change of a member's service address as stated in its register of members, and

(b)

the notice is not accompanied by notice of any resulting change in the particulars contained in its register of members' residential addresses,

the notice must be accompanied by a statement that no such change is required.
