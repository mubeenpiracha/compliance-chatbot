Guidance

The DFSA may waive or modify the application of these Rules if it is satisfied that circumstances are appropriate. See Chapter 16 of these Rules. Note that a waiver of Rule 11.2.5 will normally only be granted:

a.

if a competing Bid has been announced (in which case both Bidders will normally be bound by the time-table established by the posting of the competing Bid Document); or

b.

if the Governing Body of the Target consents to an extension.

11.2.6 On the 67th day after the day upon which the initial Bid Document was posted (or any other date beyond which the Bidder has stated that its Bid will not be extended) the Bidder must make an announcement by 5.00pm (Dubai time) as to whether the Bid is unconditional as to acceptances or has lapsed.
