Guidance

1.

The DFSA must be consulted if it is considered inappropriate or unlikely that the Bid Document is posted within this period and may, in considering any appropriate waiver or modification, require that interest for the period of delay be included in the Bid.

2.

The DFSA will not consider the merits of the Bid. It should not be assumed that because of this prior notification, the DFSA will not use powers available to it where the need for remedial action is subsequently identified.

3.

The DFSA expects that the Bid Document will be posted within 21 days of the announcement of a firm intention to make a Bid unless the bid is subject to regulatory pre-conditions of a type acceptable to the DFSA. Such regulatory pre-conditions, if acceptable to the DFSA may be permitted by way of a modification to delay the posting and disclosure of the bid documents as required under Rule 11.1.1(a) and (b) and Rule 2.4.6. Any such acceptance must be obtained in the form of a modification pursuant to Rule 16.1.
