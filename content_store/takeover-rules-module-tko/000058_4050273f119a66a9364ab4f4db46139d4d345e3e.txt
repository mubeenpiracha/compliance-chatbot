Guidance

1.

The DFSA may waive or modify the application of the Rules if it is satisfied that circumstances are appropriate. See Chapter 16 of these Rules.

2.

When the issue of new Shares as consideration for an acquisition or a cash subscription would otherwise result in an obligation to make a Mandatory Bid under the Rules in this Chapter 4, the DFSA will normally dispense with such obligation if there is a waiver thereof by a majority of independent votes at a meeting of the shareholders. The requirement for a Mandatory Bid will also be dispensed with, provided there has been a majority of independent votes at a properly constituted meeting of shareholders, in cases involving the underwriting of an issue of Shares. The DFSA may in its discretion grant a dispensation in cases where an underwriter incurs an obligation under these Rules unexpectedly, for example as a result of an inability to obtain sub-underwriters for all or part of his liability. Where a waiver or modification is granted as per this Guidance, consideration should also be given as to whether the definition of “voting rights” in Section 1.4 will require consequential modification.
