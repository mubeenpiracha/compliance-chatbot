2.2 Secrecy before Announcements

2.2.1 Before an announcement by which the relevant information is made publicly available, a Person privy to confidential information, which constitutes Material Information or otherwise, concerning a Bid or contemplated Bid must treat that information as secret and may only pass it to another Person if:

(a)

it is necessary to do so; and

(b)

that Person is made aware of the need for secrecy.

Guidance

Other legislation similarly applies to use and disclosure of confidential information. Persons associated with potential Takeover transactions should, for instance, be well aware of restrictions and prohibitions under the Markets Law 2012 including Article 58 relating to insider dealing.

2.2.2 A Person concerned in a Bid or contemplated Bid must take reasonable steps so as to

minimise the chances of an accidental leak of information.
