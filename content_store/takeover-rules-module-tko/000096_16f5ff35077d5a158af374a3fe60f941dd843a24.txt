Guidance

1.

In certain cases, Bid Documents and Target Circulars issued by the Bidder or the Target will include statements of assets reproducing Directors' estimates of asset values published with the entity's accounts. The DFSA will not regard such estimates as "given in connection with a Bid" except where asset values are a particularly significant factor in assessing the Bid and the estimates are, accordingly, given considerably more prominence in the relevant documents than merely being referred to in a note or appendix to a statement of assets.
