The remaining Rules in this Module effectively expand upon these Takeover Principles, and provide examples of their application and make provision governing specific aspects of Takeover procedure. Although most of the Rules are expressed in more detailed language than the Takeover Principles, they are not framed in technical language and, like the Takeover Principles, are to be interpreted to achieve their underlying purpose. Therefore, their spirit must be observed as well as their letter and the DFSA may waive or modify the application of a Rule if it considers that, in the particular circumstances of the case, it would operate unduly harshly or in an unnecessarily restrictive or burdensome, or otherwise inappropriate, manner. See Article 9 of the Markets Law 2012 and Chapter 16 of these Rules.
