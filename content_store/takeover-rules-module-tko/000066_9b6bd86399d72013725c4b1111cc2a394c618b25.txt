Guidance

1.

The DFSA may waive or modify the application of Rule 5.2.1 if it is satisfied that circumstances are appropriate. For example, if the Bidder considers that the highest price ought not to apply in a particular case, it must consult the DFSA, which may grant a waiver or modification to reflect an adjusted price See Chapter 16 of these Rules.

2.

Also note related provisions, Rule 3.1.1 (acquisitions before a Bid Period) and Rule 4.3.1 (consideration to be offered in a Mandatory Bid).
