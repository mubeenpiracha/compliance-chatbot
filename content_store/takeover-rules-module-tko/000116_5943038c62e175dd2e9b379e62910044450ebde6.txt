Guidance

1.

Approval is normally signified by means of a separate box on the form of acceptance.

2.

The requirement under Rule 13.3.4 may on occasion be waived if over 50% of the voting rights of the Target are held by one shareholder.

13.3.5 In making a partial Bid, the Bidder must:

(a)

make the Bid to all shareholders of a class;

(b)

make arrangements for those shareholders who wish to do so to accept in full for the relevant percentage of their holdings;

(c)

ensure that Shares tendered in excess of this percentage are accepted by the Bidder from each shareholder in the same proportion to the number tendered to the extent necessary to enable it to obtain the total number of Shares which it has sought to acquire.

13.3.6 When a Bid is made for a Target with more than one class of equity Share capital which may result in the Bidder holding Shares carrying 30% or more of the voting rights, Bids for each class must be fair and appropriate.
