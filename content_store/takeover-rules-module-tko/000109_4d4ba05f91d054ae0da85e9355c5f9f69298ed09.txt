entitled to the revised consideration.

11.4.3 The Bidder may introduce new conditions only to the extent necessary to implement

an increased or improved Bid.

11.5 Alternative Bids

11.5.1 The provisions of the Rules in Sections 11.2, 11.3 and 11.4 apply equally to

alternative Bids, including cash alternatives.

11.5.2 Where a firm statement has been made that an alternative Bid will not be extended or reintroduced and that that alternative Bid has ceased to be open for acceptance, neither that alternative, nor any substantially similar alternative, may be reintroduced. Where, however, such a statement has not been made and an alternative Bid has closed for acceptance, a Bidder is not precluded from reintroducing that alternative at a later date.
