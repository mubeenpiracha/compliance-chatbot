2.7.1 The Governing Body of a Bidder must:

(a)

obtain competent independent advice on any Bid when the Bid being made is a reverse Takeover or when the Directors are faced with a conflict of interest; and

(b)

make known the substance of such advice to its shareholders early enough to enable them to make a timely and informed decision on the merits of the Bid.

Guidance

When the Governing Body of a Bidder is required to obtain competent independent advice, it should do so before announcing its Bid or any revised Bid. Such advice should be as to whether or not the making of the Bid is in the interests of the Bidderâ€™s shareholders. Shareholders should have sufficient time to consider advice given to them prior to any general meeting held to implement the proposed Bid.
