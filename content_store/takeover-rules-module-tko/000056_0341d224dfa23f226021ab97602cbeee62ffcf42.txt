Where a Person acquires shares independently from other shareholders, and subsequently groups together with other shareholders to co-operate or to consolidate control of a Reporting Entity, and their existing shareholdings amount to 30% or more of the voting rights in the Reporting Entity, the DFSA would not normally require a Bid to be made under Rule 4.1.1. However, having once joined together, Rule 4.1.1 may apply. For example, a Mandatory Bid may be required when a member of the group acquires further shares carrying voting rights such that the total of the groups holdings reach 30% or more.

The DFSA will entertain an application for waiver or modification relating to the amount of permissible creep under Rule 4.1.1(c) or (d) only in exceptional circumstances. Without in any way limiting the DFSAâ€™s discretion, such a circumstance may include where there is a dilution of voting rights by the issue of new shares or otherwise and it is appropriate to net off the dilution against acquisitions.
