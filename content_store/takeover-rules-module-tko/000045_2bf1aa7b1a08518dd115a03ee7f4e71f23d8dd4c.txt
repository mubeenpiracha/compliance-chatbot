2.7.2 The Governing Body of a Target must:

(a)

obtain competent independent advice on any Bid including as to how it affects all shareholders; and

(b)

make known the substance of such advice to its shareholders early enough to enable them to make a timely and informed decision on the merits of the Bid.

Guidance

In obtaining advice as to how a Bid affects all shareholders, consideration should specifically be given to the effect on minority shareholders or classes of shareholders, where applicable. It is expected that the substance of any such advice will be summarised in the Target Circular. See Sections 8.1 and 8.2 of the Rules.
