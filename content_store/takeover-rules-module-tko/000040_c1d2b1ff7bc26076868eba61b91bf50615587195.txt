Guidance

The DFSA takes the view that the Person confirming availability of resources will not be expected to produce the cash itself if, in giving the confirmation, it acted responsibly and took all reasonable steps to assure itself that the cash was available.

2.4.6 When there has been an announcement of a firm intention to make a Bid, the Bidder must proceed with the Bid unless the Bid is subject to the prior fulfilment of a previously disclosed specific condition and that condition has not been fulfilled.
