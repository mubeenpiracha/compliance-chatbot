Guidance

There is no obligation to extend a Bid, the conditions of which are not met by the first or any subsequent closing date.

11.2.3 After a Bid has become or is declared unconditional as to acceptances, the Bidder must ensure that its Bid remains open for acceptance for not less than 14 days after the date on which it would otherwise have expired. When, however, a Bid is unconditional as to acceptances from the outset, a 14 day extension is not required but the Bidder must clearly and prominently set out the position in the Bid Document.

11.2.4 A Bidder must comply with any firm statement made by it as to the duration of its Bid.
