7.3 Equality of Information

7.3.1 Subject to Rule 7.3.2, information about entities involved in a Bid must be made equally available to all shareholders as nearly as possible at the same time and in the same manner.

7.3.2 Rule 7.3.1 does not apply to:

(a)

the furnishing of information in confidence by a Target to a bona fide potential Bidder or vice versa; or

(b)

the issue of circulars to their own investment clients by brokers or advisers to any party to the transaction.

7.3.3 Any information, including particulars of shareholders, given to one Bidder or potential Bidder, must, on request, be furnished equally and as promptly to another Bidder or bona fide potential Bidder, even if that other Bidder is less welcome.

7.3.4

If the Bid or potential Bid is for a management buy-out or similar transaction, the Bidder or potential Bidder must, on request, forthwith furnish the independent Directors of the Target or its advisers with all information which has been furnished by the Bidder or potential Bidder to external providers or potential providers of finance (whether equity or debt) for the buy-out.
