Profit Sharing Investment Accounts (PSIAs)

4.

PSIAs do not fall within the GEN definitions of Investments. They are contractual arrangements under which Authorised Firms invest clientsâ€™ funds, often (though not always) on a pooled basis, and are generally treated by the firm as off balance sheet. They are sometimes structured under Mudaraba, so that the investor in principle bears the full investment risk. Although PSIAs have the characteristics of a Collective Investment Fund, under an express exclusion provided under CIR Rule 2.1.13, they are not treated as such. Instead, Managing a PSIA is a distinct Financial Service as defined in GEN Rules 2.2.2(r) and 2.21.
