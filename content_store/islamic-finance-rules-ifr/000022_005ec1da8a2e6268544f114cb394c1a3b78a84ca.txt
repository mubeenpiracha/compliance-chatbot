External Shari’a reviews and periodic reports

A Fund Manager of a Domestic Fund that is a Public Fund, other than a Fund relying on the exemption in Rule 6.2.1(3), must ensure that all Shari’a reviews of the Fund are undertaken by the Shari’a Supervisory Board in accordance with AAOIFI GSIFI No 2.

(1)

In the case of a Domestic Fund that is a Public Fund other than a Fund relying on the exemptions in Rule 6.2.1(3), the Fund Manager must commission an interim and an annual report relating to the Fund operations from the Shari’a Supervisory Board which complies with AAOIFI GSIFI No 1.

(2)

The Fund Manager must deliver a copy of the annual interim report referred to in (1) to the Unitholders in accordance with CIR Rule 9.4.4 and must include the report of the Shari’a Supervisory Board in the annual report required under CIR Rule 9.4.5.

Guidance

Although the Fund Managers of Exempt Funds and Qualified Investor Funds are not subject to the Shari’a review process required under section 6.3, they would need to ensure that the Exempt Fund or Qualified Investor Fund continues to meet the Shari’a requirements, particularly for the purposes of their annual and interim reports, which are required to be prepared under CIR section 9.4. However, the manner in which they demonstrate to the Unitholders of the Fund how they achieve such compliance is a matter left to negotiation (i.e. subject to contractual terms) between the Unitholders and the Fund Manager.
