1. The issue of Securities is not an activity that constitutes a Financial Service. Therefore, the activities such as the issue of Shares, Debentures (Sukuks) or Warrants do not attract the Financial Services prohibitions in the Regulatory Law 2004. However, the Offer of Securities is an activity to which the Markets Law 2012 and the MKT module apply. Under the Markets Law 2012, a Person making an Offer of Securities in or from the DIFC is subject to numerous disclosure requirements, unless exempt. Offers of Islamic Securities which are Units of a Fund are not subject to the requirements in this section because the Collective Investment Law 2010 and CIR module provide for such activities to be regulated. Chapter 6 of this module sets out additional requirements that apply to the Fund Manager when Offering Units of an Islamic Fund.
