As Managing a PSIA is a Financial Service, the DFSA regulatory regime that applies to Persons carrying on Financial Services in or from the DIFC applies to Authorised Firms that manage PSIAs. As PSIAs are not Investments, the offer of PSIAs does not attract prospectus like disclosure. Instead, it attracts a tailored regulatory regime that applies to the entity, i.e. an Authorised Firm that manages the PSIAs (see IFR chapter 5 for these Rules). The Financial Service of Advising on Financial Products will apply to a Person giving advice on the merits of investing in a PSIA (as a PSIA is defined as a ‘financial product’ for the purposes of that activity). However, other activities such as dealing and arranging and COB requirements relating to those activities do not apply to a PSIA (as it is not an Investment as defined in GEN).
