Guidance

1.

Most of the requirements that apply to Persons conducting Financial Services or distributing Securities as Islamic or Shari’a compliant are included in this module. There are other more generic requirements relating to such Financial Services or activities that are included in other modules of the DFSA Rulebook.

2.

To enable Persons carrying on or proposing to carry on Islamic finance activities to easily access the Islamic finance related requirements applicable to their activities, the DFSA has created a web-based Islamic Finance Handbook. This handbook allows electronic navigation to reach the relevant provisions in the IFR and other DFSA Rulebook modules where Islamic finance related requirements applicable to specific Islamic finance activities are located. The handbook is accessible from the DFSA web-site.

3.

Investment Tokens are Investments defined in GEN A2.1.1(3). An Investment Token is likely to be held out as being Islamic or Shari’a compliant when it is referred to using terms such as ‘Islamic investment token, ‘Islamic security token’, ‘sukuk token’, ‘Islamic fund token’ or any other name that suggests or implies it is Islamic or Shari’a compliant.
