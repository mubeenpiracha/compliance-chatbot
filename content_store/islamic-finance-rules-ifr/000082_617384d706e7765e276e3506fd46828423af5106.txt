This chapter contains additional requirements that apply to a Collective Investment Fund operated or held out as being operated as an Islamic Fund. A Collective Investment Fund is defined in Article 11 of the Collective Investment Law 2010 (the Law). The definition in Article 11 of the Law is very wide and can capture some Islamic financial activities. However, under Article 12 of the Law, the DFSA can make Rules excluding certain arrangements or types of arrangements from constituting a Fund. Certain types of Islamic Financial Business are not regulated as Collective Investment Funds due to express exclusions provided. Key Islamic Financial Business related exclusions under the collective investment regime are Managing Insurance, participation rights evidenced by Sukuk certificates and managing PSIAs.
