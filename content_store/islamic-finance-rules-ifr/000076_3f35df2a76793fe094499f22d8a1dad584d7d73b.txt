c.

in Mudaraba investment in project finance, an Authorised Firm may use the collateralisation of the progress payments made by the ultimate customers to mitigate the exposures of unsatisfactory performance by the Mudarib.

Where an Authorised Firm places funds under a Mudaraba contract, subject to a Shari`a compliant guarantee from a third party and such a guarantee relates only to the Mudaraba capital, the capital amount should be risk-weighted at CRW of the guarantor provided that the CRW of that guarantor is lower than the CRW of the Mudarib (as a Counterparty). Otherwise, the CRW of the Mudarib will apply.

15.

An Authorised Firm placing liquid funds with a central bank or another financial institution on a short-term Mudaraba basis in order to obtain a return on those funds, may apply the CRW applicable to the Mudarib (as a Counterparty), provided the Mudarib effectively treats the liquid funds placement as its liability, although normally such placements are not treated as liabilities of the Mudarib.
