ISLAMIC FINANCE

Application

This chapter applies to every Person to whom this module applies in accordance with Section 1.1.

Activities that constitute Islamic Financial Business

Guidance

1.

Article 10 of the Law Regulating Islamic Financial Business 2004 prescribes what constitutes Islamic Financial Business. In essence, where a Person engages in any activity that constitutes a Financial Service and carries on or holds out the activity as being conducted in accordance with Shari’a, that activity constitutes Islamic Financial Business.

2.

GEN section 2.2 sets out the activities that constitute a Financial Service.

Conducting Islamic Financial Business

Guidance

1.

Article 9 of the Law Regulating Islamic Financial Business 2004 provides that in order to conduct Islamic Financial Business, the Authorised Person must have an endorsed Licence authorising it to conduct such business:

a.

as an Islamic Financial Institution; or

b.

by operating an Islamic Window.

2.

Article 11 of the Law Regulating Islamic Financial Business 2004 governs the making of an application for an endorsement to conduct Islamic Financial Business.

3.

Article 11(5) of the Law Regulating Islamic Financial Business 2004 governs the grant of an endorsement to conduct Islamic Financial Business as either an Islamic Financial Institution or by operating an Islamic Window. A Person must obtain the relevant endorsement before carrying on Islamic Finance Business as an Islamic Financial Institution or through an Islamic Window.

4.

An Authorised Person with an endorsement to operate an Islamic Window may conduct some of its activities as a conventional Financial Service while conducting its Islamic Financial Business through the Islamic Window.

5.

If Islamic Financial Business (whether through an Islamic Financial Institution or Islamic Window) is provided to Retail Clients, the Authorised Person must also have a Retail Endorsement on its Licence.

6.

A Person may, subject to any restrictions in the DFSA Rules, carry on more than one Financial Service, provided that Person has the relevant authorisations or endorsements on its Licence as are applicable.

ISLAMIC FINANCE RULES (IFR)

Islamic financial instruments and products

Guidance

1.

The DFSA regulatory regime applies to a Person carrying on any Islamic financial activities in or from the DIFC if the activity:

a.

relates to a financial instrument or product of the kind described in Guidance Notes 4 (Profit Sharing Investment Accounts), 6 (Investments), 8 (Takaful insurance) and 10 (Crypto Tokens) below; and

b.

is conducted by way of business and not expressly excluded from regulation as a Financial Service. Note there are a number of such exclusions in GEN chapter 2.

2.

The DFSA will, when considering the treatment of Islamic Financial Business arrangements, take a “substance over form” approach.

3.

The issue of financial products which are Securities such as Shares, Debentures or Units as defined in GEN A2.1.2 (which are a subset of the definition of Investments – see Guidance Note 5), attracts product specific disclosure requirements such as Prospectus or Exempt Disclosure Statements. Where such products are included on an Official List of Securities or made available to the public in the DIFC, there are initial and ongoing disclosure and other obligations that apply to the Reporting Entity (generally the issuer) under the MKT module. These MKT obligations are quite distinct from the obligations that apply to Persons carrying on Financial Services in respect of such financial products.

Profit Sharing Investment Accounts (PSIAs)

4.

PSIAs do not fall within the GEN definitions of Investments. They are contractual arrangements under which Authorised Firms invest clients’ funds, often (though not always) on a pooled basis, and are generally treated by the firm as off balance sheet. They are sometimes structured under Mudaraba, so that the investor in principle bears the full investment risk. Although PSIAs have the characteristics of a Collective Investment Fund, under an express exclusion provided under CIR Rule 2.1.13, they are not treated as such. Instead, Managing a PSIA is a
