Subject to Article 35(6):

(a)

changes to a Domestic Fund’s Constitution or Prospectus in respect of investment, borrowing or gearing powers may be made; or

(b)

the Fund Manager, the Trustee, a member of the Governing Body or the auditor of a Fund may be replaced,

if, an appropriate Special Resolution has been passed by the Unitholders at a meeting convened by the Unitholders solely for that purpose.

(2)

Any other materially significant changes not falling within Article 35(1), such as replacing a member of the Shari’a Supervisory Board or changes to the Constitution or Prospectus, which may adversely affect the Unitholders may be made in relation to a Fund if an appropriate ordinary resolution has been passed by a simple majority of the Unitholders at a meeting convened for that purpose.

(3)

If the Fund Manager and if appointed, the Trustee, consider on reasonable grounds that the change is not one that falls within Article 35(1) or (2) and will not adversely affect Unitholders’ rights, such change may be made by the Fund Manager without recourse to the Unitholders other than to notify them after the change has been effected.
