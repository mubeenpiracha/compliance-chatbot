(1)

An administrator may obtain unsecured credit and incur unsecured debt in the ordinary course of business, and any such credit or debt shall be payable as an expense of the administration in accordance with Section 143 (Vacation of office: charges and liabilities).

(2)

If an administrator is unable to obtain unsecured credit in accordance with subsection (1), the Court may, following an application by the administrator, permit for all purposes, irrespective of prior rights and prohibitions to the contrary, the obtaining of credit or the incurring of debt:

(a)

with priority over any or all expenses of the administration;

(b)

secured by a security interest on property of the insolvent estate that is not otherwise subject to a security interest; or

(c)

secured by a security interest on property of the insolvent estate where:

(i)

such property is already subject to a security interest; and

(ii)

the new security interest ranks, as a matter of priority, below any existing security interest in respect of the same property.

(3)

The Court may, following an application by the administrator, permit for all purposes, irrespective of prior rights and prohibitions to the contrary, the obtaining of credit or the incurring of debt secured by a security interest on property of the insolvent estate where:

(a)

such property is already subject to a security interest; and

(b)

the new security interest ranks, as a matter of priority, equally with or above any existing security interest in respect of the same property,

(5)

Following an application to the Court by the administrator under subsection (2) or (3), the administrator shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after the making of such application, notify each known creditor of the Company that such application has been made or, if that is not practicable in the circumstances, publish a notice of the application on the Registrar’s website and in an English language newspaper distributed in the United Arab Emirates and available in the Abu Dhabi Global Market.
