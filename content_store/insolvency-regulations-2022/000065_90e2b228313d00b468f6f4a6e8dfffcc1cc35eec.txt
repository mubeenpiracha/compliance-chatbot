170. Power to dispose of charged property

(1) Where, on an application by the administrative receiver, the Court is satisfied that the disposal (with or without other assets) of any relevant property which is subject to a security would be likely to promote a more advantageous realisation of the Company’s assets than would otherwise be effected, the Court may by order authorise the administrative receiver to dispose of the property as if it were not subject to the security.
