has voted in an administration or winding-up by the Court in relation to the unsecured balance of the secured creditor’s debt,

the secured creditor may alter the value of a security only with the permission of the Court.

Secured creditor: surrender for non-disclosure

If a secured creditor omits to disclose a security in a proof, the secured creditor must surrender that security for the general benefit of creditors, unless the Court, on application by the secured creditor, relieves the secured creditor from the effect of this paragraph 19 on the ground that the omission was inadvertent or the result of honest mistake.

If the Court grants that relief, it may require or allow the creditor’s proof to be amended, on such terms as may be just.

Secured creditor: redemption by Office-holder

The Office-holder may at any time deliver notice to a creditor whose debt is secured that the Office-holder proposes, at the expiration of 28 days from the date of the notice, to redeem the security at the value put upon it in the creditor’s proof.

The creditor then has 21 days (or such longer period as the Office-holder may allow) in which, if he so wishes, to exercise the right to alter the value of his security (with the permission of the Court, where paragraph 18(2) (Secured creditor: value of security) of Part 3 (Creditors’ Claims) of this Schedule applies but otherwise without the need for either the agreement of the Office-holder or the permission of the Court).

If the creditor alters the value of his security, the Office-holder may only redeem at the new value.

If the Office-holder redeems the security, the cost of transferring it is payable out of the assets.

A secured creditor may at any time, by notice, call on the Office-holder to elect whether the Office-holder will or will not exercise the Office-holder’s power to redeem the security at the value then placed on it; and the Office-holder then has three months in which to exercise the power or determine not to exercise it.

Secured creditor: test of security’s value

If the Office-holder is dissatisfied with the value which a secured creditor puts on his security (whether in the proof or by way of alteration of value in accordance with paragraph 18 (Secured creditor: value of security) of Part 3 (Creditors’ Claims) of this Schedule), the Office-holder may require any property comprised in the security to be offered for sale.

The terms of sale will be as agreed, or as the Court may direct; and if the sale is by auction, the Office-holder on behalf of the Company and the creditor (on his own behalf) may appear and bid.

This paragraph 21 does not apply if the value of the security has been altered with the Court’s permission.

Realisation of security by creditor

If a creditor who has valued a security subsequently realises the security (whether or not at the instance of the Office-holder)—

(a)

the net amount realised must be substituted for the value previously put by the creditor on the security; and

(b)

that amount must be treated in all respects as an amended valuation made by the creditor.

Discounts

There shall in every case be deducted from the claim all trade and other discounts (except any discount for immediate or early settlement) which would have been available but for the Insolvency Proceedings.

Administration: mutual dealings and set-off

This paragraph 24 applies in an administration where the administrator proposes to make a distribution and has delivered a notice under paragraph 31 (Notice of intention to declare a dividend) of Part 4 (Distributions to creditors) of this Schedule.
