A document is delivered if it is personally delivered in accordance with the rules for personal service in the ADGM Court Procedure Rules.

Electronic delivery of documents

A document is delivered if it is sent by electronic means and the following conditions are met.

The conditions are that the intended recipient of the document has—

(a)

given consent for the electronic delivery of the document;

(b)

not revoked that consent before the document is sent; and

(c)

provided an electronic address for the delivery of the document.

Consent may relate to a specific document or to documents generally.

Unless the contrary is shown, a document is to be treated as delivered by electronic means to an electronic address where the sender can produce a copy of the electronic communication which—

(a)

contains the document; and

(b)

shows the time and date the communication was sent and the electronic address to which it was sent.

Unless the contrary is shown, a document sent electronically is treated as delivered to the electronic address to which it is sent at 9.00 am on the next business day after it was sent.
