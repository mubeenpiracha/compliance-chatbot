 to be covered by a progress report ends on the date when an administrator of a Company ceases to act, and the period to be covered by each subsequent progress report is each successive period of six (6) months beginning immediately after that date (subject to the further application of this subsection when another administrator of the Company ceases to act).

The sending of a progress report to creditors under Section 118 (Application for extension of administration) also satisfies subsection (5) or (6) in respect of the period covered by that report; and the period to be covered by each subsequent progress report under this Section is each successive period of six (6) months beginning with the end of the period covered by the report under Section 118 (Application for extension of administration).

The administrator of a Company must, within one (1) month of the end of the period covered by the report, send—

(a)

a copy to the creditors attached to notice in the form prescribed by Schedule 1; and

(b)

a copy to the Registrar,

but this subsection does not apply when the period covered by the report is that of a final progress report under Section 111 (Final progress reports).

The Court may, on the application of the administrator of a Company, extend the period of one (1) month mentioned in subsection (8), or make such other order in respect of the content of the report as it thinks just.

If the administrator of a Company makes default in complying with this Section, he commits a contravention and is liable to a fine at the relevant level set out in the Fines Schedule.

so far as the administrator of the Company considers that—

(ii)

disclosure of the information would be prejudicial to the conduct of the administration or might reasonably be expected to lead to violence against any person; or

(iii)

the administrator of the Company is subject to an obligation of confidentiality in respect of the information,

giving reasons for not providing all of the information.

(3)

Any creditor, who need not be the same as the creditor who requested further information under subsection (1), may apply to the Court within twenty-one (21) days of—

(a)

the giving by the administrator of the Company of reasons for not providing all of the information asked for; or

(b)

the expiry of the fourteen (14) days provided for in subsection (1),

and the Court may make such order as it thinks just.

(4) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (3), the order of the Court under that subsection may extend the period of eight (8) weeks provided for in paragraph 9(3) (Creditors’ or members’ claim that remuneration is, or other expenses are, excessive) of Schedule 12 (Remuneration) by such further period as the Court thinks just.
