 such debt, or the granting of such priority or security interest, were stayed pending appeal.

(5)

Following an application to the Court by the administrator under subsection (2) or (3), the administrator shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after the making of such application, notify each known creditor of the Company that such application has been made or, if that is not practicable in the circumstances, publish a notice of the application on the Registrar’s website and in an English language newspaper distributed in the United Arab Emirates and available in the Abu Dhabi Global Market.

(6)

At a hearing of an application in respect of subsection (2) or (3), any of the following may appear to be represented:

(a)

the administrator;

(b)

any creditor which holds security over property to which the application relates; and

(c)

with the permission of the Court, any other person who appears to have an interest justifying his appearance.

109B. Adequate protection

(1) When adequate protection is required under Section 109A (Priority funding) of an interest of an entity in property, such adequate protection may be provided by:

(a)

requiring the administrator to make a cash payment or periodic cash payments to such entity, to the extent that any grant of a security interest under Section 109A (Priority funding) results in a decrease in the value of such entity’s interest in such property;

(b)

providing to such entity an additional or replacement security interest to the extent that such grant results in a decrease in the value of such entity’s interest in such property; or

(c)

granting such other relief as will result in the realization by such entity of the indubitable equivalent of such entity’s interest in such property.

(2)

For the purposes of Section 109A (Priority funding) and without limiting the scope of Section 109B(1), adequate protection is provided if the Court is satisfied that the provision of credit or debt:

(a)

would enable the administrator to achieve one of the purposes of the administration set out in Section 2(1)(a) or Section 2(1)(b); and

(b)

the grant of the security interest referred to in Section 109A(3)(a) is likely to achieve a better result for each creditor which benefits from an existing security

59

interest over the same property than would likely be achieved if the new security interest was not granted.
