 Acceptance of shares, etc. as consideration for sale of company property

(1)

This Section applies, in the case of a Company proposed to be, or being, wound up voluntarily, where the whole or part of the Company’s business or property is proposed to be transferred or sold to another company whether or not it is a Company within the meaning of the Companies Regulations 2020 (“the transferee company”).

(2) With the requisite sanction, the liquidator of the Company being, or proposed to be, wound up (“the transferor company”) may receive, in compensation or part compensation for the transfer or sale, shares, policies or other like interests in the transferee company for distribution among the members of the transferor company.

(3)

The sanction required under subsection (2) is -

(a)

in the case of a members’ voluntary winding up, that of a special resolution of the company conferring either a general authority on the liquidator or an authority in respect of any particular arrangement, and

(b)

in the case of a creditor’s voluntary winding up, that of either the Court or the Liquidation Committee.

(4)

Alternatively to subsection (2), the liquidator may (with the sanction) enter into any other arrangement whereby the members of the transferor company may, in lieu of receiving cash, shares, policies or other like interests (or in addition thereto), participate in the profits, or receive any other benefit from the transferee company.

(5)

A sale or arrangement in pursuance of this Section is binding on members of the transferor limited liability partnership.

(6)

A special resolution is not invalid for purposes of this Section by reason that it is passed before or concurrently with a resolution for voluntary winding-up or for appointing liquidators; but, if an order is made within a year for winding-up of the Company by the Court, the special resolution is not valid unless sanctioned by the Court.

(7)

If a special resolution of the Company has provided the sanction requisite for the liquidator under this Section, a member of the transferor company who did not vote in favour of providing the sanction required for the liquidator under this Section may express his dissent from it in writing addressed to the liquidator and left at the registered office of the Company within 7 days after the date on which that sanction was given, and require the liquidator either to abstain from carrying the arrangement so sanctioned into effect or to purchase his interest at a price to be determined by agreement or arbitration under this Section.

(8)

If the liquidator elects to purchase the member’s interest, the purchase money must be paid before the Company is dissolved and be raised by the liquidator in such manner as may be determined by special resolution.
