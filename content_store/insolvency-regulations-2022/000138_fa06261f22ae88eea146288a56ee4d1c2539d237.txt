(b)

that amount must be treated in all respects as an amended valuation made by the creditor.

Discounts

There shall in every case be deducted from the claim all trade and other discounts (except any discount for immediate or early settlement) which would have been available but for the Insolvency Proceedings.

Administration: mutual dealings and set-off

This paragraph 24 applies in an administration where the administrator proposes to make a distribution and has delivered a notice under paragraph 31 (Notice of intention to declare a dividend) of Part 4 (Distributions to creditors) of this Schedule.

An account must be taken as at the date of the notice referred to in sub-paragraph (1) of what is due from the Company and a creditor to each other in respect of their mutual dealings and the sums due from one party must be set off against the sums due from the other.

If there is a balance owed to the creditor then only that balance is provable in the administration.

If there is a balance owed to the Company under sub-paragraph (3) that must be paid to the administrator as part of the assets. However if all or part of the balance owed to the Company results from a contingent or prospective debt owed by the creditor then the balance (or that part of it which results from the contingent or prospective debt) must be paid in full (without reduction under paragraph 46 (Debt payable at future time) of Part 4 (Distributions to creditors) of this Schedule) if and when that debt becomes due and payable.
