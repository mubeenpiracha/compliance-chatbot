Administration and winding-up: provisions as to dividends

In an administration or winding-up, in the calculation and distribution of a dividend the Office-holder must make provision for—

(a)

any debts which appear to the Office-holder to be due to persons who, by reason of the distance of their place of residence, may not have had sufficient time to deliver their proofs;

(b)

any debts which are the subject of claims which have not yet been determined; and

(c)

disputed proofs and claims.

Administration and winding-up: non-payment of dividend

In an administration or winding-up, no action lies against the Office-holder for a dividend; but if the Office-holder refuses to pay a dividend the Court may, if it thinks just, order the Office-holder to pay it and also to pay, out of the Office-holder’s own money—

(a)

interest on the dividend, at the official interest rate, from the time when it was withheld; and

(b)

the costs of the proceedings in which the order to pay is made.

Supplementary provisions as to dividends

A creditor is not entitled to disturb the payment of any dividend or making of any distribution because—

(a)

the amount claimed in the creditor’s proof is increased after payment of the dividend or making of the distribution;

(b)

in an administration or creditors’ voluntary winding-up or compulsory winding- up the creditor did not prove for a debt before the declaration of the dividend; or

(c)

in a members’ voluntary winding-up, the creditor did not prove for a debt before the last date for proving or increases the claim in proof after that date.

However the creditor is entitled to be paid or receive, out of any money for the time being available for the payment of any further dividend or making of any further distribution, any dividend or distribution which he has failed to receive.

Any dividend or dividends payable under this paragraph must be paid or distribution made before that money is applied to the payment of any further dividend or making of any further distribution.

If, after a creditor’s proof has been admitted, the proof is withdrawn or excluded, or the amount of it is reduced, the creditor is liable to repay to the Office-holder, for the credit of the Insolvency Proceedings, any amount overpaid by way of dividend.

Secured creditors

The following applies where a creditor alters the value of a security after a dividend has been declared.

If the alteration reduces the creditor’s unsecured claim ranking for dividend, the creditor must as soon as reasonably practicable repay to the Office-holder, for the credit of the

207

administration or the insolvent estate, any amount received by the creditor as dividend in excess of that to which the creditor would be entitled, having regard to the alteration of the value of the security.

(3)

If the alteration increases the creditor’s unsecured claim, the creditor is entitled to receive from the Office-holder, out of any money for the time being available for the payment of a further dividend, before any such further dividend is paid, any dividend or dividends which the creditor has failed to receive, having regard to the alteration of the value of the security.

(4)

However, the creditor is not entitled to disturb any dividend declared (whether or not distributed) before the date of the alteration.

44.

Disqualification from dividend

If a creditor contravenes any provision of these Regulations relating to the valuation of securities, the Court may, on the application of the Office-holder, order that the creditor be wholly or partly disqualified from participation in any dividend.

45.

Assignment of right to dividend

(1)

If a person entitled to a dividend (“the entitled person”) delivers notice to the Office- holder that the entitled person wishes the dividend to be paid to another person, or that the entitled person
