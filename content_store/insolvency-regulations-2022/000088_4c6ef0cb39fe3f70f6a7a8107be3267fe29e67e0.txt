contribute such sum to the Company’s assets by way of compensation in respect of misfeasance or breach of fiduciary or other duty as the Court thinks just.

251. Fraudulent trading

(1)

If in the course of the winding-up of a Company or while it is in administration it appears that any business of the Company has been carried on with intent to defraud creditors of the Company or creditors of any other person, or for any fraudulent purpose, subsection (2) applies.

(2)

The Court, on the application of the liquidator or the administrator, as the case may be, may declare that any persons who were knowingly parties to the carrying on of the business in the manner mentioned are liable to make such contributions (if any) to the Company’s assets as the Court thinks proper.

252. Wrongful trading

(1)

Subject to subsection (3) below, if in the course of the winding-up of a Company or while it is in administration it appears that subsection (2) applies in relation to any person being a past or present Director of the Company, the Court, on the application of the relevant Office-holder, may declare that person is to be liable to make such contribution (if any) to the Company’s assets as the Court thinks fit.

(2)

This subsection (2) applies if—

(a)

the Company has gone into an insolvent liquidation or has entered insolvent administration;

(b)

at some time before the commencement of the winding-up of the Company or before the Company entered administration, as the case may be, the person knew or ought to have concluded that there was no reasonable prospect of the Company avoiding going into insolvent liquidation or entering insolvent administration; and

(c)

the person was a Director of the Company at that time.

(3)

Subsection (1) shall not apply to any person if the Court is satisfied that after the Director first knew or ought to have concluded that there was no reasonable prospect of the Company avoiding going into insolvent liquidation, he took every step with a view to minimising the potential loss to the Company’s creditors as (on the assumption that the person had knowledge of the matter mentioned in subsection (2)(b)) he ought to have taken.

(4)

For the purposes of this Section, the facts which a Director of the Company ought to know, the conclusions which he ought to reach and the steps which he ought to take are those which would be known, or reached or taken, by a reasonably diligent person having both—

(a)

the general knowledge, skill and experience that may reasonably be expected of a person carrying out the same functions as are carried out by that Director in relation to the Company (including functions which he does not carry out but which have been entrusted to him); and

(b)

the general knowledge, skill and experience that Director has.

(5)

This Section is without prejudice to Section 251 (Fraudulent trading).

(6)

In this Section, Director includes a shadow director.
