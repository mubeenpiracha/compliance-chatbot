 any other credit substitute (other than an insurance contract) in favour of another party, so that the segment is exposed to the risk of having to make payment on those instruments should the guaranteed party default.

A6.7.2 An Insurer must calculate its off-balance sheet risk component as the sum of the amounts obtained by applying the calculations set out in Rule A6.7.3 in respect of each guarantee, letter of credit or other credit substitute.

A6.7.3 The amount in respect of a guarantee, letter of credit or other credit substitute (other than an insurance contract) is obtained by calculating, for the nominal amount of the guarantee, letter of credit or other credit substitute, a default risk component as set out in section A6.4 and an investment volatility risk component as set out in section A6.5 in respect of the obligation or asset over which the guarantee, letter of credit or other credit substitute is written, as though that obligation or asset were an obligation or asset of the Insurer.

A6.8 Concentration risk component

Guidance

The purpose of the concentration risk component is to require an Insurer to set aside capital to cover the sensitivity that it has to default or volatility in respect of assets and exposures to single counterparties or groupings of connected counterparties, or single properties. The provisions in this section apply the relevant provisions of section A4.8 to the segments of a Protected Cell Company.

A6.8.1 An Insurer is required to calculate a concentration risk component in respect of a segment if the segment has, as at the Solvency Reference Date, an investment exposure to a single counterparty or group of Related counterparties, or to a single property, that exceeds 10% of the adjusted segmental capital resources.

A6.8.2 For the purposes of the calculation referred to in Rule A6.8.1:

(a)

‘investment exposure’ means the aggregate value of all equity, bond or other investments in or in respect of the counterparty or group of Related parties or property in question, together with off-balance sheet exposures to the same counterparty or group of Related counterparties or property

that the Insurer has because it has issued guarantees, letters of credit or other credit substitutes (other than insurance contracts), or because it has entered into derivative contracts, but excluding any assets excluded from base cellular capital or base non-cellular capital by reason of any of the Rules referred to in Rule A6.4.3(b);

(b)

‘adjusted segmental capital resources’ in respect of a segment means Adjusted Cellular Capital Resources in respect of that segment (where the segment is a Cell) or the Insurer’s Adjusted Non-Cellular Capital Resources (where the segment is not a Cell); and

(c)

‘AAA’-Rated Governments and Government agencies are not counterparties.

A6.8.3 An Insurer must calculate its concentration risk component in respect of a segment as the sum of the amounts obtained by multiplying each investment exposure of that segment that exceeds 10% of the adjusted segmental capital resources, by the relevant factor percentage set out in the table set out in Rule A4.8.3, reading that table as though all references to Adjusted Capital Resources were references to adjusted segmental capital resources, and subject to Rule A6.8.4.

A6.8.4

If the concentration risk component in respect of an investment exposure of a segment, aggregated with the sum of the default risk, investment volatility risk and off-balance sheet asset risk components (so far as concerns that segment), in respect of the assets and off-balance sheet exposures comprising that investment exposure, exceeds 100% of that investment exposure, the concentration risk component in respect of that investment exposure must be reduced so that the total of the four components in respect of that investment exposure is equal to 100% of that investment exposure.

A6.9 Size factor component

Guidance

The effect of the size factor component is to provide a relatively higher capital requirement in respect of segments with smaller portfolios of Invested Assets. The provisions in this section apply the relevant provisions of section A4.9 to the segments of a Protected Cell Company.

A6.9.1 The base figure for the size factor component is determined by aggreg
