5 operates to prohibit, among other things, lending between Long Term Insurance Funds of the same Insurer. Assets must not be organised in such a manner as to create indebtedness between Long Term Insurance Funds.

An Insurer may not enter into any arrangement, whether or not described as a contract of reinsurance, whereby a Long-Term Insurance Fund of the Insurer stands in the same relation to the Insurer as though the Insurer were the reinsurer in a contract of reinsurance in which the Long-Term Insurance Fund is the cedant.

Guidance

Rule 3.5.6 operates to prohibit reinsurance between Long Term Insurance Funds of the same Insurer, as well as arrangements of the nature of internal contracts of reinsurance where the cession transaction is attributed to a Long-Term Insurance Fund but the corresponding reinsurance acceptance transaction is not.

Guidance

1.

The features described in Rule 3.6.1(1) have the potential to expose an Insurer to risks that are not adequately provided for in the capital adequacy framework set out in this Rulebook. The DFSA retains the power to prohibit or limit the inclusion of such features in a Long-Term Insurance contract where it is of the view that the inclusion of such features may have a materially adverse impact upon the long term viability of the Insurer. It is natural for Insurers to seek to stimulate a market by offering features such as guarantees or options. However, the solvency of Insurers could be threatened if they have not adequately valued, stress-tested and set aside adequate capital to service such features. Therefore, the DFSA will expect Insurers seeking permission to write contracts with such features to demonstrate that these steps have been undertaken, and that their procedures provide adequately for ongoing monitoring of the associated risks. Permission to undertake such business may be subject to conditions, for example, a requirement to maintain additional capital, or to restrict business of this
