Guidance

1.

Financial firms frequently decide to outsource aspects of their operations to other parties, Related or not. Outsourcing can bring significant benefits to a firm in terms of efficiency, cost reduction and risk management. However, both the process of implementing outsourcing arrangements and the outsourcing relationship itself may expose a firm to additional risk. It is therefore important that firms take care to supervise the conduct of activities that are outsourced. GEN Rule 5.3.requires an Authorised Firm to inform the DFSA about any material outsourcing arrangement.

2.

The activities of outsource contractors have the ability to undermine the risk management activities of Insurers. Insurers should take particular care if outsourcing activities such as underwriting and claims management, where inappropriate performance of the functions can expose the Insurer to serious financial loss, for example through acceptance of inappropriate insurance risks, mis-pricing, failure to obtain appropriate reinsurance cover, or failure to detect invalid claims. These considerations apply to such arrangements as binding authorities and other agencies appointed by Insurers.
