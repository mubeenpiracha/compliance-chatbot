Guidance

1.

An Insurerâ€™s ALM policy should be appropriate taking into account the nature, scale and complexity of its ALM risks.

2.

The ALM policy should include details as to how:

(a)

the investment and liability strategies adopted by the Insurer allow for the interaction between assets and liabilities;

(b)

the correlations are taken into account;

(c)

the liability cash flows will be met by cash inflows; and

(d)

the valuations of assets and liabilities will change under an appropriate range of different scenarios.
