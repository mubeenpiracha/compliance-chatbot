 adjustment.

A5.2.2 Adjusted non-cellular equity is calculated as set out in section A5.4. The hybrid

non-cellular capital adjustment is set out in section A5.5

A5.3 Base non-cellular capital

Guidance

The commencement point for calculating an Insurer’s adjusted non-cellular equity is the Insurer’s base non-cellular capital.

A5.3.1 Subject to Rules A5.3.2 and A5.3.3, an Insurer’s base non-cellular capital consists

of the following capital instruments and equity reserves of the Insurer:

(a)

paid-up ordinary shares, except for shares referred to in Rule A5.5.1(3);

(b)

general reserves;

(c)

retained earnings;

(d)

current year’s earnings after tax; and

(e)

hybrid non-cellular capital (as defined in Rule A5.5.1).

A5.3.2 All Cell Share Capital and any capital instruments or equity reserves of the Insurer

that are attributable to a Cell must be excluded from base non-cellular capital.

A5.3.3 Hybrid non-cellular capital having a term to maturity of less than five years may only be included in base non-cellular capital with the written consent of the DFSA.

A5.4 Adjusted non-cellular equity

A5.4.1 An Insurer must calculate its adjusted non-cellular equity by adding items to and deducting them from its base non-cellular capital, as set out in this section.

Guidance

1.

The purpose of these adjustments is to provide a consistent basis for the determination of the Insurer’s Adjusted Non-Cellular Capital Resources and to exclude from those resources assets that may not be readily realisable for the purposes of meeting any Non-Cellular Liabilities of the Insurer.

2.

A Takaful Insurer may not count as non-cellular capital amounts loaned to Insurance Funds that are attributable to Cells, as those amounts will be counted towards base cellular capital of the Cells concerned.
