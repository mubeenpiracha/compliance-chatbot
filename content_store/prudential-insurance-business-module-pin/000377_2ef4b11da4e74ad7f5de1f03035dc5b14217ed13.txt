A10.2 Completion of forms for global, cell, fund and DIFC business

reporting units

Guidance

Separate Returns are completed for Insurers’ entire business, and for those parts of the business that are subject to separate capital adequacy requirements, namely Cells, Long-Term Insurance Funds, and DIFC business. These parts, and the entire business, are described as ‘reporting units’ because a Return is required for each. An Insurer may therefore have to submit more than one set of Returns.

A10.2.1 A Return must be completed in respect of each of the reporting units set out in this

section that applies to the Insurer.

A10.2.2 There are three types of reporting units in respect of which an Insurer may be required to submit a Return. These are referred to in this appendix and the forms as the Cell reporting unit, the fund reporting unit and the DIFC business reporting unit. The Returns in respect of these reporting units are referred to respectively in this appendix and the forms as the Cell Return, the Fund Return and the DIFC Business Return.
