(b)

the Owners’ Equity is available for loan to the Insurance Fund of the Insurer.

A3.4 Adjusted equity

A3.4.1 An Insurer must calculate its adjusted equity by adding items to and deducting them

from its base capital, as set out in this section.

A3.4.2 The following items must be added to base capital, to the extent that the Insurer has

excluded them in determining its base capital:

(a)

any minority interests in companies that are Subsidiaries of the Insurer; and

(b)

any amount in respect of dividends to be paid by the Insurer in the form of shares.

A3.4.3 The following items must be deducted from base capital, to the extent that the Insurer has not excluded them in determining its base capital, or has added them to base capital under Rule A3.4.2:

(a)

any amounts in respect of appropriations to be made from profit in respect including dividends, of distributions by Takaful Insurers of surplus, bonuses, pensions and welfare charges that are determined on the basis of the profit of that reporting period, whether or not the amounts have been approved by the Insurer for payment;
