Guidance

This Rule establishes de minimis limits for an Insurer in respect of detailed numerical information presented by Class of Business or by type of insurance contract. These de minimis limits do not apply for Direct Long-Term Insurance Business carried on by a DIFC Incorporated Insurer. Amounts below the de minimis limits may be aggregated together with other items of information in the same line or column of a form. Insurers are not required to apply the sub-sections in the order that they are set out. However, Insurers should ensure that the Returns continue to comply with both sub-sections after applying either. It is possible that applying the second sub-section to be applied could affect compliance with the first.
