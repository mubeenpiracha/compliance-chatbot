Because the Financial Group Capital Requirement set out in Rule 8.3.4 includes capital requirements in respect of Group entities, capital resources may be included in the calculation of Financial Group Capital Resources to the extent of those requirements. Capital that is surplus to those requirements is however subject to an additional condition before it may be taken into account for the purposes of Financial Group capital adequacy.

In general, Capital Resources or Adjusted Capital Resources are considered not to be freely transferable if they are subject to a legal or constructive limitation on their transferability, whether that transfer would be made by dividend, return or capital or other form of distribution. Examples of relevant limitations might include obligations to maintain minimum capital requirements to meet domestic solvency requirements, or to comply with debt covenants.
