Guidance

A10.2.5 operates to prevent the preparation of duplicate Returns. However, where under this section an Insurer or a Cell is exempt from the requirement to prepare a Quarterly Regulatory Return because of its captive status, the Fund Quarterly Regulatory Return would not be identical and must still be prepared.

A10.2.6 An Insurer that is not a DIFC Incorporated Insurer must complete a DIFC Business

Return. A DIFC Business Return has the following characteristics:

(a)

it includes only liabilities that are Insurance Liabilities of the Insurer in respect of its DIFC Insurance Business and assets that are associated with those Insurance Liabilities; and

(b)

revenues and expenses must be included only to the extent that they are attributable to the Insurerâ€™s DIFC Insurance Business.
