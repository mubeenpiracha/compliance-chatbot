(a)

if x ≤ 100, the factor is 1.5;

(b)

if 100 < x ≤ 200, the factor is (150 + 0.5(x-100))/x;

(c)

if 200 < x ≤ 1,200, the factor is (200 – 0.2(x-200))/x; and

(d)

if x > 1,200, the factor is zero.

A8.10 Long-term insurance risk component

Guidance

The purpose of the Long-Term Insurance risk component is to require an Insurer to set aside capital to address the risk that the net present value of future Policy Benefits will vary from the amounts recorded as Long-Term Insurance Liabilities in the Insurer’s balance sheet. The provisions in this section apply the relevant provisions of section A4.12 to each Long-Term Insurance Fund that an Insurer maintains.

A8.10.1 An Insurer must calculate the Long-Term Insurance risk component in respect of a Long-Term Insurance Fund according to the method set out in section A4.12, applied as though all references in that section to an Insurer were instead references to that fund.
