 exposure, the concentration risk component in respect of that investment exposure must be reduced so that the total of the four components in respect of that investment exposure is equal to 100% of that investment exposure.

A6.9 Size factor component

Guidance

The effect of the size factor component is to provide a relatively higher capital requirement in respect of segments with smaller portfolios of Invested Assets. The provisions in this section apply the relevant provisions of section A4.9 to the segments of a Protected Cell Company.

A6.9.1 The base figure for the size factor component is determined by aggregating the

following components, for the segment:

(a)

the aggregate of the default components determined in accordance with section A6.4, in respect of Invested Assets;

(b)

the investment volatility risk component determined in accordance with section A6.5; and

(c)

the concentration risk component determined in accordance with section A6.8.

A6.9.2 An Insurer must calculate the size factor component in respect of a segment by multiplying the base figure for that segment as determined in accordance with Rule

A6.9.1 by the factor derived by applying the following formula, where x represents the total Invested Assets of the segment, expressed in millions of dollars:

(a)

if x ≤ 100, the factor is 1.5;

(b)

if 100 < x ≤ 200, the factor is (150 + 0.5(x-100))/x;

(c)

if 200 < x ≤ 1,200, the factor is (200 – 0.2(x-200))/x; and

(d)

if x > 1,200, the factor is zero.

A6.10 Underwriting risk component

Guidance

1.

The purpose of the underwriting risk component is to require an Insurer to set aside capital to address the risk that the cost of claims will vary from the cost implicit in the premiums being charged. The provisions in this section apply the relevant provisions of section A4.10 to the segments of a Protected Cell Company.

2.

As Insurance Business in Protected Cell Companies may only be carried on through Cells, every Insurer will have an underwriting risk component of zero in respect of its Minimum Non-Cellular Capital Requirement.

A6.10.1 An Insurer must calculate the underwriting risk component in respect of a segment according to the method set out in section A4.10, applied as though all references in that section to an Insurer were instead references to that segment.

A6.11 Reserving risk component

Guidance

1.

The purpose of the reserving risk component is to require an Insurer to set aside capital to address the risk that the cost of claims will vary from the amounts recorded as liabilities in the Insurer’s balance sheet. This calculation applies only to liabilities in respect of outstanding claims (the risk of deterioration in Premium Liability is addressed in the underwriting risk component in section A6.10). The provisions in this section apply the relevant provisions of section A4.11 to the segments of a Protected Cell Company.

2.

As Insurance Business in Protected Cell Companies may only be carried on through Cells, every Insurer will have a reserving risk component of zero in respect of its Minimum Non- Cellular Capital Requirement.

A6.11.1 An Insurer must calculate the reserving risk component in respect of a segment according to the method set out in section A4.11, applied as though all references in that section to an Insurer were instead references to that segment.

A6.12 Long-term insurance risk component

Guidance

1.

The purpose of the Long-Term Insurance risk component is to require an Insurer to set aside capital to address the risk that the net present value of future Policy Benefits will vary from the amounts recorded as Long-Term Insurance Liabilities in the Insurer’s balance sheet. The provisions in this section apply the relevant provisions of section A4.12 to the segments of a Protected Cell Company.

2.

As Insurance Business in Protected Cell Companies may only be carried on through Cells, every Insurer will have a Long-Term Insurance risk component of zero in respect of its Minimum
