Guidance

This chapter requires an Insurer to provide the DFSA with a report by an Actuary in respect of its Insurance Liabilities and assets arising in respect of those liabilities (that is, assets which are contingent on the existence and amount of the liabilities, such as reinsurance, salvage and subrogation recoveries). Separate provisions apply in respect of reports on General Insurance Business and Long- Term Insurance Business.
