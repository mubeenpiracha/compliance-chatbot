Investment volatility risk component

Guidance

The purpose of the investment volatility risk component is to require an Insurer to set aside capital to cover the risk of deterioration in the values of Invested Assets. Invested Assets that are linked to liabilities of Investment-Linked Insurance contracts are exempted from the calculation, since there is a direct correlation between the values of the assets and the values of the liabilities to which they are linked.

A4.5.1 Subject to Rule A4.5.2, an Insurer must calculate its investment volatility risk component as the sum of the amounts obtained by multiplying the value of each Invested Asset with the relevant percentage applicable to that asset as set out in the following table.
