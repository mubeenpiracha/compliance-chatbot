Guidance

The purpose of these adjustments is to provide a consistent basis for the determination of the Insurer’s Adjusted Fund Capital Resources and to exclude from those resources assets that may not be readily realisable for the purposes of meeting Insurance Liabilities of the Long-Term Insurance Fund.

A7.4.2 The following items must be deducted from base fund capital, to the extent that the

Insurer has not excluded them in determining its base fund capital:

(a)

any amounts in respect of appropriations to be made from the Long-Term Insurance Fund in respect of the current year, including dividends, distributions by Takaful Insurers of surplus, bonuses, pensions and welfare charges that are determined on the basis of the current year’s profit, whether or not the amounts have been approved by the Insurer for payment;

(b)

the amount of any investment by the Long-Term Insurance Fund or by a Subsidiary of the Long-Term Insurance Fund, in the Insurer’s own capital;

(c)

the amount of any tax liability that would be attributable to unrealised gains on investments, if those gains were realised;
