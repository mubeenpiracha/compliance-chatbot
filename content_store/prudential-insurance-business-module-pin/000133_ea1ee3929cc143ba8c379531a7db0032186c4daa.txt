monitoring compliance with Financial Group reporting requirements.

Guidance

1.

For the purposes of the above requirement, an Insurer may take into account its position within its Group, the materiality of the risk to which it is exposed because of its membership of the Group, and the access that it has to the systems and controls of other members of its Group and any information produced by them or by Associates. For example, it would be reasonable for a small Insurer within a larger Group to place some reliance on its Parent to ensure that appropriate systems and controls are in place.

2.

An Insurer may also consider together Groups whose Parents are all members of the same Group, except for any Group of which the Insurer is the Parent. An Insurer that is itself the Parent of a Group must give specific consideration to the risks to which it is exposed as the Parent. The DFSA will not otherwise however normally expect an Insurer to apply the provisions of this Rule to sub-Groups of a single Group.
