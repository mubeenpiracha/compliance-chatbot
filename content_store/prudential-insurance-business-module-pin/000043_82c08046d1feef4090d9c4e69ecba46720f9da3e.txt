A2.10 Liquidity management risk

Guidance

1.

An Insurer should have access to sufficient liquidity to meet all cash outflow commitments to policyholders (and other creditors) as and when they fall due. The nature of insurance activities means that the timing and amount of cash outflows are uncertain. This uncertainty may affect the ability of an Insurer to meet its obligations to policyholders or may require Insurers to incur additional costs through, for example, raising additional funds at a premium on the market or through the sale of assets.

2.

The risk management system for liquidity should normally include at least the following policies and procedures:

a.

procedures to identify and control the level of mismatch between expected asset and liability cash flows under normal and stressed operating conditions (using realistic scenarios relevant to the circumstances of the Insurer);

b.

procedures to monitor the liquidity and realisability of assets;

c.

procedures to identify and monitor commitments to meet liabilities including Insurance Liabilities;

d.

procedures to monitor the uncertainty of incidence, timing and magnitude of Insurance Liabilities;

e.

procedures to identify and monitor the level of liquid assets held by the Insurer; and

f.

procedures to identify and monitor other sources of funding including reinsurance, borrowing capacity, lines of credit and the availability of intra-group funding, and to identify the need for such sources to be made available.

3. When assessing its liquidity requirements an Insurer should also consider the currency in which the assets and liabilities are denominated, and the locations in which those assets and liabilities are situated or payable.

A2.11 Credit quality risk

Guidance

1.

Credit exposures can increase the risk profile of an Insurer and adversely affect financial viability. Credit exposure includes both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures (including guarantees, derivative financial instruments and performance related obligations) to single and Related counterparties.

2.

An Insurer’s risk management system in respect of credit quality risk will normally be expected to include at least the following policies and procedures:

a.

limits (where relevant, at both an individual and consolidated level) for credit exposures to:

i.

single counterparties and groupings of counterparties that are related to each other;

ii.

entities to which the Insurer is Related;

iii.

single industries; and

iv.

single geographical locations;

b.

processes to monitor and control credit exposures against pre-approved limits;

c.

processes for identifying breaches of limits and for ensuring that breaches of limits are brought within the pre-approved limits within a set timeframe;

d.

processes for reducing or cancelling limits to a particular counterparty where the counterparty is known to be experiencing problems;

e.

processes for approving requests for temporary increases in limits;

f.

processes to review credit exposures (at least annually but more frequently in cases where there is evidence of a deterioration in credit quality);

g.

a management information system that is capable of aggregating exposures to any one counterparty (or group of Related counterparties), asset class, industry or region in a timely manner; and

h.

a process for reporting to the Governing Body and senior management:

i.

significant breaches of limits; and

ii.

large exposures and other credit risk concentrations.

3.

Further guidance in respect of credit quality risk in respect of reinsurance counterparties is contained at A2.14.

A2.12 Business continuity planning risk

Guidance

1.

Disruptions in an Insurer’s business can lead to unexpected losses of both a financial and non- financial nature (e.g. data, premises, reputation etc). Disruptions may occur as a result of

events such as power failure, denial of access to premises or work areas, systems failure (computers, data, building equipment), fire, fraud and loss of key staff.

2.

An Insurer’s risk management system in respect of business continuity planning risk will normally be expected to include at least the following policies and procedures:

a.

processes for identifying:

i.

events that may lead to a disruption in business continuity;

ii.

the likelihood of those events occurring;

iii.

the processes most at risk; and
