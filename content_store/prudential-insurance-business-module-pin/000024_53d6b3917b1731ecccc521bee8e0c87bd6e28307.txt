 for the purposes of a decision on allocation of bonuses and surplus for the purposes of determining the capital adequacy of the Fund. For the former of these two purposes, the insurer is identifying the pool, commonly known as surplus, that is available for allocation as bonuses (or equivalent) on participating policies. The allocation then reduces the surplus (note – by convention, this is treated as happening as at the reporting date). By contrast, for the latter of the two purposes, that portion of the remaining surplus that is expected to be allocated eventually to policyholders is also treated as a liability (in Rule 5.6.7), on the grounds that it is not available to absorb losses of the Insurer. For that purpose, declaration of bonuses merely represents a transfer from one recognised liability to another. Factors that the Actuary should consider for the purposes of Rule 7.3.6(p) may include risks that may vary between the jurisdictions in which business is carried on, as well as generic risks. The former category might include the risk of political unrest, and the latter operational risks such as fraud.

The DFSA may specify additional information to be presented in the Actuary’s report. Guidance to Rule 3.6.1 indicates that, where the DFSA permits an Insurer to carry on Direct Long-Term Insurance Business with features of a kind described in Rule 3.6.1(1), it may, as a condition of that permission, require additional information to be provided in the Actuary’s

report. That additional information could include, for example, detail on market-consistent valuations of guarantees or options, and the results of scenario testing.

7.3.7

Subject to Rule 7.3.8, where an Insurer carries on Direct Long-Term Insurance Business, the report referred to in Rule 7.3.5 must include the information set out in Rule 7.3.6 in respect of such business segregated by the jurisdiction in which it is carried on.

7.3.8 Where business in a jurisdiction is of limited significance, disclosures may, at the

discretion of the Actuary, be aggregated for those jurisdictions.
