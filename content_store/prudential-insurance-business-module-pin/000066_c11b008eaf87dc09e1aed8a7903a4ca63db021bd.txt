Because an Insurer is required to maintain adequate capital resources at all times, its systems and controls need to enable the directors to determine and monitor the capital requirements of the Insurer and the capital resources that it has available, and to identify occurrences where the capital resources fall short of the capital requirements or may fall short in the future. An Insurer is not required to measure the precise amount of its capital resources and its capital requirements on a daily basis. However an Insurer should be in a position to demonstrate its capital adequacy at any time if asked to do so by the DFSA.
