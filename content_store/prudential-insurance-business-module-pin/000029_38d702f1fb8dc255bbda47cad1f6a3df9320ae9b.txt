address all material risks, financial and non-financial, to which the Insurer is likely to be exposed;

(c)

describe the relationships between the Insurer’s risk tolerance limits, its capital requirements, economic capital and the processes and methods for monitoring risk; and

be supported by adequate risk management policies and procedures which explain the risks covered, the measurement approaches used, and the key assumptions made.

(a)

a written risk management strategy approved by senior management, which in the opinion of senior management addresses all material risks to which the Insurer is likely to be exposed;

(b)

risk management policies and procedures that in the opinion of senior management are adequate to identify, assess, mitigate, control, monitor and report on the material risks to which the Insurer is exposed; and
