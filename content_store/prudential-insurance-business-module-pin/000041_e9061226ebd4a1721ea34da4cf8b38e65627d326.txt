include appropriate testing of the robustness of the portfolio in changing investment conditions, using realistic scenarios relevant to the circumstances of the Insurer.

10.

Stress and scenario testing should consider the impact of possible deteriorations in investment conditions, including where relevant the impact of simultaneous deteriorations in more than one market. It should also consider effects on liquidity, including where relevant those from an inability to repatriate assets from elsewhere. Where the insurance industry’s holdings are large in relation to the turnover of the domestic market, scenario modelling should take account of the possible effect on the market of simultaneous liquidation of assets.

The risk management system for underwriting risk should normally include at least the following policies and procedures:

a.

clear identification and quantification of the Insurer’s willingness and capacity to accept risk;

b.

clear identification of the classes and characteristics of insurance business that the Insurer is prepared to underwrite including:

i.

geographical areas;

ii.

the types of risk that may be underwritten; and

iii.

criteria for the use of policy exclusions and reinsurance;

c.

formal evaluation processes for the effective assessment of risks underwritten including:

i.

criteria for assessing risk;

ii.

methods for monitoring emerging experience; and

iii. methods by which emerging experience is taken into account in updating the

b.

make an assessment of the amount and incidence of the claim liability, including loss adjustment expenses; and

c.
