6.3 Price Stabilisation from the DIFC

6.3.1

(1)

A Person who conducts, from the DIFC, Price Stabilisation of dual-listed Eligible Securities on an exchange outside the DIFC must:

(a)

ensure that such Price Stabilisation is conducted in accordance with the law of that non-DIFC Jurisdiction; and

(b)

provide the DFSA adequate prior notification of such Price Stabilisation.

Guidance

This Rule allows a Person who is acting as a Stabilisation Manager in respect of a dual-listing of Eligible Securities to rely on the laws of another jurisdiction to conduct those activities outside the DIFC. The Rule is designed to provide Stabilisation Managers with some limited flexibility in respect of their activities.
