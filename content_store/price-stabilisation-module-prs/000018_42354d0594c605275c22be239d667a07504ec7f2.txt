Guidance

Some participants in the Price Stabilisation may have accrued positions during stabilisation and Rule 3.5.1 permits transactions to ‘square-off’ the positions between participants. The terms on which these transactions may be carried may often be agreed in the terms of engagement between the Stabilisation Manager and his Stabilisation Agents. The DFSA may when inspecting records kept relating to stabilisation seek the rationale for any of these transactions and the price at which they were conducted.
