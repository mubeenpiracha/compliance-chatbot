PRICE STABILISATION

2.1 Application

2.1.1 This chapter applies to a Stabilisation Manager and to any Stabilisation Agents

appointed by him.

2.2 Permitted Price Stabilisation

2.2.1

(1)

A Stabilisation Manager and, if applicable, his Stabilisation Agents may in respect of Eligible Securities

(a)

purchase, or agree to purchase, such Eligible Securities; or

(b)

offer or attempt to do anything in (a) with a view to stabilising the Market Price of such Eligible Securities.

(2)

A Stabilisation Manager and, if applicable, his Stabilisation Agents must not, when engaging in an activity described in (1), in respect of Shares, Certificates over Shares, Warrants over Shares, and Units that are shares representing the rights or interests of Unitholders in a Fund, conduct such activity at a price higher than the Offer Price.

Guidance

Pricing limits do not extend to Debentures hence Rules 2.2.1(2) do not apply with respect to Debentures. Pricing for Debentures is subject instead to the requirement in 2.2.1(1) that the stablising action is taken to support the Market Price.

2.2.2 A Stabilisation Manager and his Stabilisation Agents may, in respect of Eligible

Securities:

(a)

make allotments of a greater number of the Eligible Securities than were offered (“over-allotment”);

(b)

sell or agree to sell the Eligible Securities in order to establish a short position in them;

(c)

buy or agree to buy the Eligible Securities in order to close out or liquidate any position that has been established by Price Stabilisation under (a) or (b);

(d)

sell or agree to sell the Eligible Securities in order to close out or liquidate any position that has been established by Price Stabilisation under (a) or (b); or
