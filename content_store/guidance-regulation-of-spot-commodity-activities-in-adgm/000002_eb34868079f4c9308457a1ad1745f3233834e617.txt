 key transactional activities relating to the global commodity trading ecosystem.

12) While the Spot Commodities Framework allows for a number of potential Regulated Activities in relation to Spot Commodities to be undertaken within ADGM, the FSRA anticipates that the requirements of the Framework are such that they will most likely be

satisfied by Spot Commodity market participants and trading venues already operating in established markets. Examples of such activities may therefore include, but not be limited to:

a)

a ‘Commodity Derivative’ RIE providing a market in Financial Instruments and for Spot Commodities (pursuant to a stipulation in its Recognition Order);

b)

a ‘Commodity Derivative’ RIE operating an MTF as a secondary market for Spot Commodities;

c)

a ‘Commodity Derivative’ intermediary, such as a broker, dealer or trader, operating an MTF or OTF as a secondary market for Spot Commodities;

d)

a Commodity producer operating an MTF or OTF as a (secondary and primary) market for Spot Commodities;

e)

a Price Reporting Agency operating an MTF for the primary purpose of Spot Commodity price discovery;

f)

Spot Commodity auctions, used as part of any of the activities in COBS Rule 22.9.1 in addition to the activities set out in (a), (b), (c) and (d) above;

g)

the trading or pricing of Spot Commodity premiums, including location and location differential pricing, brands and hallmarks, and other Spot Commodity characteristics or related specifications, used as part of any of the activities set out in (a), (b), (c) and (d) above;

h)

an RIE providing a market in Financial Instruments (including Commodity Derivatives) operating an MTF or OTF in Spot Commodities (pursuant to a stipulation in its Recognition Order);

i)

a ‘Commodity Derivative’ RCH providing settlement/clearing services for Spot Commodity trading venues; and

j)

an Authorised Person Providing Credit in relation to the storage and transport (including but not limited to) shipping of Accepted Spot Commodities, used in relation to any of the activities set out in (a), (b), (c), (d) and (g) above.

13) The FSRA intends that the Spot Commodities Framework further builds, and expands on, the existing methods for regulatory oversight of Spot Commodity markets, including for the combined oversight of Commodity Derivative, Environmental Instrument and Spot Commodity markets. Additionally, the Spot Commodities Framework intends to address key risks that the sourcing of spot commodities pose (via COBS Rule 22.3).

14) The FSRA also notes that observations of Spot Commodity markets by Price Reporting Agencies (“PRAs”) and other similar bodies are widely used to price and settle Financial Instruments, including Futures, swaps, ETFs and indexes. The informal and unregulated nature of some PRA services risks the integrity of some financial markets and may directly harm consumers. The Spot Commodities Framework specifically seeks to address this through providing a regulated framework to operate these PRAs, including through the use of auctions. Importantly, the Spot Commodities Framework also addresses issues relating to ethical and environmental governance, disclosure/transparency, Market Abuse and the

regulation of MTFs and OTFs, by using the Spot Commodities Framework in a manner similar to the regulatory approach taken in relation to securities/derivatives exchanges globally.

16) For clarification, the Spot Commodities Framework does not apply to:

a)

any activities involving Commodity Derivatives;

b)

capital formation/capital raising;

c)

any activities Commodities;

involving Spot Commodities

that are not Accepted Spot

d)

the securitisation of any Spot Commodity or group of Spot Commodities; or

e)

any other activity or arrangement using Spot Commodities that is deemed by the Regulator not to constitute part of a Regulated Activity, where necessary and appropriate in order for the Regulator to pursue its objectives.
