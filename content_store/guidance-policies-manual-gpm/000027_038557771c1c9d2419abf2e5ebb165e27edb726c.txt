Step 1 - Assessment of complaints and referrals

Assessment of complaints and referrals concerning suspected misconduct or suspected contraventions is a key function of our regulatory remit and enforcement framework. Every complaint and referral, regardless of source, is assessed to determine whether an investigation or other action ought to take place.

Sources of complaints and referrals

We may become aware of suspected misconduct or suspected contraventions from a

variety of sources, including:

(a)

members of the public;

(b)

our supervisory activities; and

(c)

other external regulatory authorities or law enforcement agencies.

Complaints

Complaints received by us from members of the public that relate to:

GPM VER06.020125

(a)

any conduct of, or dissatisfaction with, any person regulated by us;

(b)

a potential contravention of FSMR or Rules; or

(c)

any conduct that causes, or may cause, damage to the reputation of ADGM or the financial services industry in ADGM;

(d)

are classified as regulatory complaints and are assessed through our complaints management function.

A person wishing to lodge a regulatory complaint with us should, where possible, do so

in writing. A complaint can be lodged by:

(a)

using https://www.adgm.com/operating-in-adgm/additional-obligations-of-financial- services-entities/enforcement/complaints/submit-a-complaint;

our

that

(b)

email to: FSRA.Complaints@adgm.com;

(c)

sending the complaint to Financial Services Regulatory Authority, Abu Dhabi Global Market, PO Box 111999, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; or

(d)

delivering the complaint to us at Financial Services Regulatory Authority, Abu Dhabi Global Market Square, Al Maryah Island, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

Upon receipt of a complaint, we will:

(a)

provide a written acknowledgement;

(b)

assess the complaint to determine the most appropriate regulatory action, if any, to be taken; and

(c)

provide a written final response to the complaint.

Our assessment of the complaint may involve:

(a)

requesting further information or documents from the person making the complaint;

(b)

liaising internally with specialists within the FSRA;

(c)

contacting the subject of the complaint, where necessary and appropriate, or other persons who may have information relevant to the matter; and/or

(d)

contacting other regulatory authorities.

All complaints submitted to us are held in confidence in accordance with the confidentiality requirements of FSMR as set out in section 3.5 of this manual. However, in order to assess a complaint properly, we may need to speak to third parties including other regulatory authorities or the subject of the complaint. Where it is the subject of the

Confidential

GPM VER06.020125

complaint, we will endeavour to notify the complainant of this or (if appropriate) seek their consent for us to do so.

We endeavour to complete assessments within 28 days of receipt of a complaint. However, some assessments may take longer, depending on the nature and complexity of the complaint.

We will provide each complainant with a final response when the assessment of the complaint has been completed. If, during the assessment of a regulatory complaint, we identify suspected contraventions or misconduct within our jurisdiction, we will consider whether to proceed with an investigation or take some form of regulatory action.

Referrals

There are two types of referrals - internal and external.

(a)

Internal referrals

(b)

Internal referrals usually originate from our supervisory activities. Our supervisory framework is designed to detect and mitigate risks to ADGM and the financial services industry in ADGM.

(c)

An internal referral usually occurs where our supervision function identifies possible contraventions of our legislation and considers that the matter warrants referral to our enforcement department for further review.

(d)

When the enforcement function receives an internal referral, the referring function will continue
