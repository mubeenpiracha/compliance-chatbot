Application for withdrawal of a Financial Services Permission

2.9.1

In considering requests for the withdrawal of a Financial Services Permission, a firm will need to satisfy us that it has made appropriate arrangements with respect to its existing customers, including the receipt of any customers' consent where required and, in particular:

Confidential

GPM VER06.020125

(a)

whether there may be a long period in which the business will be run off or transferred;

(b)

whether deposits must be returned to customers;

(c)

whether money and other assets belonging to customers must be returned to them; and

(d)

whether there is any other matter which we would reasonably expect to be resolved before granting a request for the withdrawal of a Financial Services Permission.

2.9.2

In determining a request for the withdrawal of a Financial Services Permission, we may require additional procedures or information as appropriate, including evidence that the firm has ceased to carry on Regulated Activities.

2.9.3 A firm should submit detailed plans where there may be an extensive period of wind- down. It may not be appropriate for a firm to immediately request a withdrawal of its Financial Services Permission in all circumstances, although it may wish to consider reducing the scope of its Financial Services Permission during this period. Firms should discuss these arrangements with us.

2.9.4 We may also refuse a request for the withdrawal of a Financial Services Permission

where:

(a)

the firm has failed to settle its debts owed to us; or

(b)

it is in the interests of a current or pending investigation by us, or by another regulatory body or authority.

2.9.5 Some other matters that a firm should be mindful of in relation to the withdrawal of its

Financial Services Permission include:

(a)

where a firmâ€™s FSP is withdrawn, the approved status of its Approved Persons will also be withdrawn on the same date. However, this does not remove the obligation on a firm to provide a statement where an Approved Person has been dismissed or requested to resign (under GEN 8.7.3); and

(b)

where a Fund Manager or the Trustee makes a request for withdrawal (under GEN 8.4.1), the Fund Manager or the Trustee will need to satisfy us that it has made appropriate arrangements in accordance with the requirements under the FUNDS Rules with respect to the continuing management of the Fund for which it is the Fund Manager or the Trustee, as the case may be.

2.10 Application for variation of a Financial Services Permission

2.10.1 Where a firm applies to change the scope of its Financial Services Permission, it should

provide the following information:

Confidential

20

GPM VER06.020125

(a)

a revised business plan as appropriate, describing the basis of, and rationale for, the proposed change;

(b)

details of the extent to which existing documentation, procedures, systems and controls will be amended to take into account any additional activities, and how the firm will be able to comply with any additional regulatory requirements;

(c)

descriptions of the firm's senior management responsibilities (see GEN Chapter 5) where these have changed from those previously disclosed, including any updated staff organisation charts and internal and external reporting lines;

(d)

details of any transitional arrangements where the firm is reducing its activities and where it has existing customers who may be affected by the cessation of a Regulated Activity;

(e)

the appropriate financial reporting statement where the variation may result in a change to the firm's prudential category or the application of additional or different financial rules. If a capital increase is required in order to demonstrate compliance with additional financial rules but such capital is not paid up or available at the time of application, proposed or forecast figures may be used;

(f)

details of the effect of the proposed variation on the Approved Persons including, where applicable, submitting any written applications for individuals to perform additional or new controlled functions, or to remove existing controlled functions; and

(g)

revised pro forma financial statements.

2.10.2 In considering whether a firm is fit and proper with respect to a change in the scope of its Financial Services Permission, we may take into account the various matters set out in this Chapter that provide guidance on assessing fitness and propriety for firms.
