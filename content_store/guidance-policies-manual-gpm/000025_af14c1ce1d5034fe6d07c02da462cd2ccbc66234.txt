ENFORCEMENT

6.1

Our approach to enforcement

6.1.1 This Chapter sets out our approach to enforcement including how we may commence and conduct investigations and exercise our powers to address any misconduct or contravention of FSMR or Rules. Our approach to imposing a penalty can be found in Chapter 8 of this document. For our general approach to publicity in certain circumstances, see Chapter 10.

We also have powers to investigate and address contraventions of our Common Reporting Standard Regulations 2017 and our Foreign Account Tax Compliance Regulations 2022 (“Tax Reporting Regulations”). We have set out our approach to enforcement activity relating to the Tax Reporting Regulations in its own section in GPM, see Chapter 11.

The fair and proportionate use of our enforcement powers plays a critical role in fulfilling

our objectives as set out in section 1(3) of FSMR.

There are a number of principles underlying our approach to the exercise of our

enforcement powers, including:

(a)

the effectiveness of the regulatory regime depends on the maintenance of an open and co-operative relationship between us and those we regulate;

(b)

we adopt a risk-based approach to regulation, focusing our efforts on those activities that we perceive as posing the greatest risk to the furtherance of our objectives;

(c)

we will act fairly, openly, accountably and proportionately in the exercise of our enforcement powers;

(d)

we will act swiftly and decisively to stop conduct which threatens the integrity of ADGM or the stability of the financial services industry in ADGM, minimise its effects, and prevent such conduct from re-occurring;

(e)

we aim to:

(i)

deter or reduce the likelihood of future non-compliance;

(ii)

reduce or eliminate any financial gain or benefit from non-compliance; and

(iii)

where appropriate, remedy the harm caused by the non-compliance.
