whether the individual had previously been told about our concerns in relation to the issue, either by means of a private warning or in supervisory correspondence;

whether the individual had previously undertaken not to perform a particular act or engage in particular behaviour;

Step 4: Adjustment for deterrence

If we consider the figure arrived at after Step 3 is insufficient to deter the individual who committed the contravention, or others, further or similar contraventions then we may increase the financial penalty. Circumstances where we may do this include:

(a)

where we consider the absolute value of the penalty too small in relation to the contravention to meet our objective of credible deterrence;

(b)

where our previous action in respect of similar contraventions has failed to improve industry standards. This may include similar contraventions relating to different products;

(c)

where we consider it is likely that similar contraventions will be committed by the individual or by other individuals in the future; and

(d)

where we consider that the likelihood of the detection of such a contravention is low.

Step 5: Adjustment for cooperation/early settlement

We and the individual on whom a penalty is to be imposed may seek to agree on the amount of any financial penalty and other terms. In recognition of the benefits of such agreements, and of the individualâ€™s cooperation with us, section 8.8 provides that the amount of the financial penalty which might otherwise have been payable may be reduced to reflect the stage at which we and the individual concerned reached an agreement. Any adjustment for early settlement does not apply to the disgorgement of any benefit calculated at Step 1.

8.7

Serious financial hardship

Our approach to determining financial penalties, as described in sections 8.5 and 8.6, is intended to ensure that financial penalties are proportionate to the circumstances of any contravention. We recognise that financial penalties may affect persons differently, and that we should consider whether a reduction or suspension in the proposed financial penalty may be appropriate if such penalty would cause the subject of enforcement action serious financial hardship.

Where an individual or firm claims that payment of the financial penalty proposed by us will cause them serious financial hardship the onus is on the individual or firm to satisfy us that payment of the financial penalty will cause them serious financial hardship. We will consider whether to reduce the proposed financial penalty only if:

(a)

the individual or firm provides verifiable evidence that payment of the financial penalty will cause them serious financial hardship;

(b)

the individual or firm provides full, frank and timely disclosure of the verifiable evidence, and co-operates fully in answering any questions asked by us about their financial position; and

(c)

we are satisfied that payment of the financial penalty will cause the individual or firm serious financial hardship.

Individuals

In assessing whether a financial penalty would cause an individual serious financial hardship, we will consider the individual's ability to pay the financial penalty over a reasonable period, including agreeing to payment of the financial penalty by instalments

where the individual requires time to realise their assets, for example, by waiting for payment of a salary or by selling property.

Firms

We will consider reducing the amount of a financial penalty if a firm will suffer serious financial hardship as a result of having to pay the entire financial penalty. In deciding whether it is appropriate to reduce the financial penalty, we will take into consideration the firm's financial circumstances, including whether the financial penalty would render the firm insolvent or threaten the firm's solvency. We will also take into account our statutory objectives, for example, in situations where
