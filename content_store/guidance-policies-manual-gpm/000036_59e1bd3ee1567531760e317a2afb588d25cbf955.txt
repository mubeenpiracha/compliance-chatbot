, and any aggrieved persons, broad powers to make an application for recovery of damages where there has been an identified contravention of FSMR or the Rules.

We may decide not to commence proceedings in every case where there may have been a relevant contravention. This does not, however, prevent any aggrieved person from commencing their own proceedings. An aggrieved person may exercise rights under section 242 of FSMR independently of, or contemporaneously with, us.

In determining whether to commence proceedings, we will take into account all relevant

circumstances, including:

(a)

the nature and seriousness of the contravention;

(b)

whether the contravention is ongoing;

(c)

whether the contravention affects, or has the potential to affect, our objectives;

(d)

whether a person who may have suffered detriment as a result of the contravention is able to take their own remedial action;

(e)

in circumstances where more than one person has suffered loss or damage:

(i)

the number of those that have suffered loss or damage and the amount of loss or damage involved; and

(ii)

whether it is convenient or possible for a class of aggrieved persons to commence a proceeding;

(f)

the cost we would incur in applying for or enforcing any order;

(g)

whether the conduct in question can be adequately addressed by the use of other regulatory powers;

(h)

whether redress is available elsewhere or through another regulatory authority;

(i)

whether there is a reason to believe that the person is or has been, involved in money laundering, terrorist financing or other form of financial crime or criminal conduct;

(j)

whether the profits are quantifiable;

(k)

whether the person is solvent; and

(l)

whether we have a reasonable prospect of success in the relevant proceedings.

7.11 Restitution

Restitution is intended to restore a person to the position they would have been in had there not been a contravention. Under sections 239 and 240 of FSMR, we may seek a Court Order for restitution, and pursuant to section 241 of FSMR we also have a power to require restitution.

In deciding whether to exercise our powers to seek or require restitution under sections 239, 240 or 241 of FSMR, we will take into account all relevant circumstances, including:

Confidential

GPM VER06.020125

(a)

whether the profits are quantifiable;

(b)

whether the losses are identifiable;

(c)

the number of persons affected;

(d)

our costs in pursuing restitution;

(e)

whether compensation is available elsewhere or through another regulatory authority;

(f)

whether a person who may have suffered loss is able to take their own action;

(g)

whether the person is solvent;

(h)

whether other powers are available;

(i)

the behaviour of the person(s) suffering loss.

In cases where it is appropriate to exercise our powers to seek or require restitution, we will generally first consider whether it is appropriate to use our administrative power in section 241 before considering taking Court action. However, there may be circumstances in which we will use the powers in sections 239 and 240 of FSMR to seek a Court Order for restitution. Those circumstances may include where:

(a)

we wish to combine an application for an order for restitution with other Court action, for example, where we may wish to seek an injunction to stop particular misconduct;

(b)

we wish to bring related Court proceedings for unauthorised activity where the factual basis for those proceedings is likely to be the same as the claim for restitution;

(c)

there is a danger that assets may be dissipated, in which case we may wish to combine an application to the Court for restitution with an application for an asset-freezing injunction to prevent assets from being dissipated;

(d)

we suspect the relevant person may not comply with an administrative requirement to pay restitution; in those cases we may consider that the sanction for breach of a Court Order may be needed to ensure compliance.

In determining the amount of restitution to seek or require, we may use our powers to require information and documents to enable us to determine the amount of profits made and/or losses suffered or any other adverse effects resulting from the conduct of the relevant person.

As well as obtaining information through our power to require information and documents described above, we may consider using our power in section 203 of FSMR to require a report prepared by a Skilled
