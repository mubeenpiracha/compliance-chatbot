Application to be a Representative Office

2.8.1 An applicant seeking to become a Representative Office will need to comply with

requirements including those set out in GEN Chapter 9.

2.8.2

In assessing an application for a Representative Office, we will need to be satisfied that:

(a)

the proposed activities are that of marketing, which means providing information on investments or financial services; engaging in promotions of investments or financial services; or making introductions or referrals of investments or financial services. It does not include advising on investments or the receiving or transmitting of orders (see paragraph 67 of Schedule 1 of FSMR); and

(b)

the applicant is incorporated and regulated by another regulatory authority and is setting up in ADGM as a branch.

2.8.3

In assessing an application to establish a Representative Office, the Regulator will also consider whether it is in the interests of ADGM to grant such an authorisation, having regard to the limited scope of activity that may be carried out under such authorization and the Regulator’s objectives and guiding principles as outlined in sections 1(3) and (4) of FSMR. It is not the Regulator’s intent that an approval granted under GEN 9.3.1 be regarded as encouraging the establishment of entities in ADGM that are solely marketing entities with minimal business presence and economic substance. The application will be reviewed favourably if the Applicant is able to demonstrate clear plans and commitment to scale its activities in ADGM.
