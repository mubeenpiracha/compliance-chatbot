 requirements or rulings of another regulatory authority relating to the contravention;

(i)

the previous disciplinary record and general compliance history of the firm;

(j)

action taken against the firm by other domestic or international regulatory authorities that is relevant to the contravention in question;

(k)

whether our Guidance or other published materials had already raised relevant concerns, and the nature and accessibility of such materials;

(l)

whether we publicly called for an improvement in standards in relation to the behaviour constituting the contravention or similar behaviour before or during the occurrence of the contravention; and

(m)

the treatment of any whistleblower or complainant(s) involved in identifying the contravention.

Step 4: Adjustment for deterrence

If we consider the figure arrived at after Step 3 is insufficient to deter the firm who committed the contravention, or others, further or similar contraventions then we may increase the financial penalty. Circumstances where we may do this include:

from committing

(a)

where we consider the absolute value of the financial penalty too low in relation to the contravention to meet our objective of credible deterrence;

(b)

where our previous action in respect of similar contraventions has failed to improve industry standards;

(c)

where we consider it likely that similar contraventions will be committed by the firm or by others in the future in the absence of such an increase to the financial penalty; and

(d)

where we consider that the likelihood of the detection of such a contravention is low.

Step 5: Adjustment for cooperation/early settlement

We and the firm upon whom a financial penalty is to be imposed may seek to agree the amount of any financial penalty and other terms. In recognition of the benefits of such agreements, and of the firmâ€™s cooperation with us, section 8.8 provides that the amount of the financial penalty which might otherwise have been payable may be reduced to

reflect the stage at which we and the firm concerned reached an agreement. Any adjustment for early settlement does not apply to the disgorgement of any benefit calculated at Step 1.

Financial penalties imposed on an individual

Step 1: Disgorgement

We will seek to deprive an individual of the economic benefits derived from the contravention (which may include the profit made or loss avoided) where it is possible to quantify this. We will ordinarily also charge interest on the benefit.

Step 2: The seriousness of the contravention

We will determine a financial penalty figure that reflects the seriousness of the contravention. In determining such a figure, we will take into account the following factors relating to:

(a)

the impact of the contravention;

(b)

the nature of the contravention;

(c)

whether the contravention was deliberate; and

(d)

whether the contravention was reckless.

Factors relating to the impact of a contravention committed by an individual include:

(a)

the level of benefit gained or loss avoided, or intended to be gained or avoided, by the individual from the contravention;

(b)

the loss or risk of loss, as a whole, caused to clients, investors or other market users in general;

(c)

the loss or risk of loss caused to individual clients, investors or other market users;

(d)

whether the contravention had an effect on particularly vulnerable people, whether intentionally or otherwise;

(e)

the distress or inconvenience caused to clients; and

(f)

whether the contravention had an adverse effect on the orderliness of, or confidence in, markets and, if so, how serious that effect was.

Factors relating to the nature of a contravention by an individual include:

(a)

the nature of the provisions of our legislation that were contravened;

(b)

the frequency of the contravention;

(c)

the nature and extent of any financial crime facilitated, occasioned or otherwise attributable to the contravention;

(d)

the scope for any potential financial crime to be facilitated, occasioned or otherwise occur as a result of the contravention;

(e)

whether the individual failed to act with integrity or abused a position of trust;

(f)

whether the individual caused or encouraged other individuals to commit contraventions;

(g)

whether the individual held a prominent position within the industry;

(h)

whether the individual is an
