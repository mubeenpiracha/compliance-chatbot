sanction: a firm or individual should be penalised for wrongdoing; and

(c)

deterrence: any penalty imposed should deter the firm or individual who committed the contravention, and others, from committing further or similar contraventions.

The total amount payable by a person subject to enforcement action may be made up of

two elements:

(a)

disgorgement of the benefit received as a result of the contravention; and

(b)

a financial penalty reflecting the seriousness of the contravention.

These elements are incorporated in a five-step framework, which can be summarised as

follows:

Confidential

GPM VER06.020125

(a)

Step 1: the removal of any economic benefit derived from a contravention;

(b)

Step 2: the determination of a figure which reflects the seriousness of the contravention;

(c)

Step 3: an adjustment made to the Step 2 figure to take account of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances;

(d)

Step 4: an adjustment made to the Step 3 figure, where appropriate, to ensure that the penalty has an appropriate deterrent effect; and

(e)

Step 5: if applicable, an adjustment for cooperation/early settlement may be made.

The steps set out above process will be considered, to the extent applicable, in each case. The details of Steps 1 to 4 will differ for cases against firms (section 8.5), and cases against individuals (section 8.6).

The lists of factors and circumstances in sections 8.5 and 8.6 are not exhaustive. Not all of the factors or circumstances listed will necessarily be relevant in a particular case and there may be other factors or circumstances not listed which are relevant.

We will not, in determining our policy with respect to the amount of penalties, take account of expenses which we incur, or expect to incur, in discharging its functions.

Financial penalties imposed on a firm

Step 1: Disgorgement

We will seek to deprive a firm of the economic benefits derived from a contravention (which may include the profit made or loss avoided) where it is practicable to quantify this.

Step 2: The seriousness of the contravention

We will determine a financial penalty figure that reflects the seriousness of the

contravention, taking into account the following factors relating to:

(a)

the impact of a contravention;

(b)

the nature of a contravention;

(c)

whether a contravention was deliberate; and

(d)

whether a contravention was reckless.

Factors relating to the impact of a contravention committed by a firm include:

(a)

the level of benefit gained or loss avoided, or intended to be gained or avoided, by the firm from the contravention;

(b)

the loss or risk of loss, as a whole, caused to clients, investors or other market users in general;

(c)

the loss or risk of loss caused to individual clients, investors or other market users;

(d)

whether the contravention had an effect on particularly vulnerable people, whether intentionally or otherwise;

(e)

the distress or inconvenience caused to clients; and

(f)

whether the contravention had an adverse effect on the orderliness of, or confidence in, markets and, if so, how serious that effect was.

Factors relating to the nature of a contravention by a firm include:

(a)

the nature of particular provision(s) of our legislation that were contravened;

(b)

if the contravention happened repeatedly;

(c)

whether the contravention revealed serious or systemic weaknesses in the firm's procedures or in the management systems or internal controls relating to all or part of the firm's business;

(d)

whether the firm's senior management were aware of the contravention;

(e)

the nature and extent of any financial crime facilitated, occasioned or otherwise attributable to the contravention;

(f)

the scope for any potential financial crime to be facilitated, occasioned or otherwise occur as a result of the contravention;

(g)

whether the firm failed to conduct its business with integrity; and

(h)

whether the firm, in committing the contravention, took any steps to comply with FSMR and Rules, and the adequacy of those steps.
