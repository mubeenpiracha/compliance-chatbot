 in combination with other forms of disciplinary or regulatory action, for example, with a suspension of Financial Services Permission or Approval, disqualification of an auditor or actuary, or a Prohibition Order.

Actions against Approved Persons

In addition to the general factors listed in paragraph 8.2.1, there are some additional considerations that may be relevant when we decide whether to take action against an Approved Person. The list is not exhaustive. Not all of these factors may be applicable in a particular case and there may be other factors, not listed, that are relevant. The factors include:

(a)

the Approved Personâ€™s position and responsibilities. We will take into account the responsibility of those exercising important functions in the firm. The more senior the person responsible for the misconduct, the more seriously we are likely to view the misconduct, and the more likely it is we will take action against the Approved Person;

(b)

whether disciplinary action against both the firm and the Approved Person responsible for the misconduct would be appropriate, or whether action against only the individual would be a more appropriate regulatory response;

(c)

whether disciplinary action against the Approved Person would have a greater deterrent effect than action against just the firm; and

(d)

whether disciplinary action would be a proportionate response to the nature and seriousness of the contravention by the person.

8.3

Financial penalty or public censure

We will consider all the relevant circumstances of the case when deciding whether to impose a financial penalty or public censure. As such, the factors set out in section 8.2 are not exhaustive. Not all of the factors may be applicable in a particular case and there may be other factors, not listed, that are relevant.

The criteria for determining whether it is appropriate to issue a public censure or a financial penalty include those factors that we will consider in determining the amount of a financial penalty set out in sections 8.4 to 8.7. Some particular considerations that may be relevant when we determine whether to issue a public censure rather than impose a financial penalty are:

(a)

whether deterrence may be effectively achieved by issuing a public censure;

(b)

depending upon the nature and seriousness of the contravention:

(i)

whether the person has brought the contravention to our attention;

(ii)

whether the person has admitted the contravention and provides full and immediate co-operation to us, and takes steps to ensure that those who have suffered loss due to the contravention are fully compensated for those losses;

(c)

our approach to previous similar cases, in order to achieve consistent outcomes for similar cases; and

(d)

the impact on the person concerned. In an exceptional case, where the impact of a financial penalty would make the action disproportionate, we may decide it is appropriate to issue a public censure rather than impose a financial penalty.

Some particular considerations that may be relevant when we determine whether to

issue a financial penalty rather than impose a public censure are:

(a)

if the person has made a profit or avoided a loss as a result of the contravention, on the basis that a person should not be permitted to benefit from committing a contravention;

(b)

if the contravention is more serious in nature or degree, on the basis that the sanction should reflect the seriousness of the contravention; other things being equal, the more serious the contravention, the more likely we are to impose a financial penalty; and

(c)

if the person has a poor disciplinary record or compliance history, on the basis that it may be particularly important to deter future cases.

8.4

Determining the appropriate level of financial penalty

Our penalty-setting regime is based on three principles:

(a)

disgorgement: a firm or individual should not benefit from any contravention;

(b)

sanction: a firm or individual should be penalised for wrongdoing; and

(c)

deterrence: any penalty imposed should deter the firm or individual who committed the contravention, and others, from committing further or similar contraventions.

The total amount payable by a person subject to enforcement action may be made up of

two elements:

(a)

disgorgement of the benefit received as a result of the contravention; and

(b)

a financial penalty reflecting the seriousness of the contravention.

These elements are incorporated in a five-step framework, which can be summarised
