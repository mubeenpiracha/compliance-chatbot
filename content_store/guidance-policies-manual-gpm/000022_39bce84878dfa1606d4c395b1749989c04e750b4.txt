(b)

the firm has contravened legislation administered by us or there is a reasonable likelihood it might do so; or

(c)

we consider that the exercise of the power is necessary or desirable in the pursuit of one or more of our objectives, for example, in circumstances where there is a risk of an adverse effect on its Customers or an enforcement action or insolvency proceedings have commenced.

In determining whether to exercise this power, we will take into account all relevant facts and circumstances, including whether the firm's management is able to address our concerns. Furthermore, we will have regard to the principle that any restriction imposed on a firm should be proportionate to the objectives which we are seeking to achieve.

Examples of Requirements that we may consider imposing include, among other things,

a requirement:

(a)

not to take on new business;

(b)

not to hold or control Client Money;

(c)

not to trade in certain categories of Specified Investment;

(d)

prohibiting or restricting the disposal of, or other dealing with, any of the firm's assets (whether in ADGM or elsewhere); and

(e)

that all or any of the firm's assets (or all or any assets belonging to investors but held by the firm) must be transferred to a trustee approved by us.

Power to vary or cancel a Financial Services Permission

At the request of a firm

We may vary or cancel a firm’s Financial Services Permission on the application of the

firm (in such form as we may prescribe) (see section 32 of FSMR).

We may require the firm to satisfy certain regulatory requirements prior to variation or cancellation of the Financial Services Permission, at our sole discretion. We may also refuse an application to vary or cancel if we consider it desirable to meet our objectives. This might include, for example, circumstances where we have concerns about the firm’s activities which need to be resolved before the variation or cancellation is appropriate.

On our own initiative

We may exercise our powers to cancel a Financial Services Permission to carry on one or more Regulated Activities where it appears to us that one or more of the circumstances set out in section 33(1) of FSMR apply. In such cases, we may vary the Financial Services Permission by adding or removing a Regulated Activity from the Financial Services Permission or varying the description of a Regulated Activity where it does not widen the description. We may also vary the Financial Service Permission by including in it (as

varied) any provision that could be included if a new Financial Service Permission were being sought. We may also cancel the Financial Services Permission entirely.

Examples of circumstances where we might exercise our powers to vary or cancel a

Financial Services Permission could include where:

(a)

we have serious concerns about the manner in which the business of the firm is being conducted;

(b)

we consider it necessary to protect other participants in the ADGM Financial System from adverse effects such as financial loss or the risk of significant financial loss;

(c)

the firm has failed to have or maintain adequate financial resources or failed to comply with regulatory capital requirements;

(d)

the firm has not submitted regulatory returns in a timely fashion or has provided false information in regulatory returns;

(e)

the firm no longer satisfies the Threshold Conditions to carry out a Regulated Activity (set out in the GEN Chapter 5);

(f)

the firm has contravened FSMR or the Rules.

5.6

Power to withdraw or vary Approval of an Approved Person

Under section 46 of FSMR, we may withdraw an Approval given in relation to the performance of a Controlled Function where we consider that the Approved Person is not fit and proper to perform the Controlled Function in question. Circumstances where we might exercise this power could include where:

(a)

the individual is in breach of an obligation required by their Approved Person status;

(b)

the individual becomes bankrupt;

(c)

the individual is convicted of an offence or there is a finding against them that would be considered relevant to their integrity and honesty, or their ability to perform the relevant Controlled Function(s);

(d)

(e)

the individual or the relevant firm asks us to withdraw the relevant status.
