 to Recognised Bodies and Remote Bodies, the procedures we will follow in doing so, and the factors we will take into consideration when deciding whether or not – and how – to exercise such powers.

These powers include:

(a)

requiring a Recognised Body to do specified things, including closing the market, suspending transactions and prohibiting trading in Investments, pursuant to Part 14 of FSMR and Chapter 2 of MKT; and

(b)

supervision of a Recognised Body’s action in the case of a default, under their Default Rules pursuant to MIR 6.5. This could include direction to take, or not take, any action and to take action on behalf of the Recognised Body in certain circumstances.

5.9

Power to revoke recognition

With consent

We may revoke a Recognition Order at the request or otherwise with the consent of the

relevant Recognised Body or Remote Body pursuant to section 134(1) of FSMR.

On our own initiative

We may exercise our power to revoke a Recognition Order where it appears to us that the relevant body is failing or has failed to satisfy the applicable Recognition Requirements or Remote Recognition Requirements (as the case may be), or any other obligation imposed on it under our legislation.

The circumstances in which we will consider revoking a Recognition Order are set out in section 134 of FSMR and in MIR. The procedure applicable to giving a Direction or revoking a Recognition Order is set out in section 135 of FSMR.
