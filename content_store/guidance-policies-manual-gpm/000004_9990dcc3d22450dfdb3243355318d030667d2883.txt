Close Links

We need to be satisfied as to who the applicant’s Close Links are or where the applicant is closely related to another person (for example a parent or subsidiary company or someone who owns and controls 20% or more of the applicant). This is to make sure we are not prevented from effectively supervising the applicant.

Legal status of firms and Recognised Bodies

We will only consider an application for authorisation or recognition where the legal status of the proposed ADGM entity is a Body Corporate or a Partnership. Individuals cannot make an application. In respect of the regulated activities of Effecting Contracts of Insurance or Carrying Out Contracts of Insurance as Principal, a firm can only be a Body Corporate.

In the case of non-ADGM persons other than companies limited by shares, we will consider whether the legal form is appropriate for the activities proposed.

If the applicant is seeking to branch into ADGM, we will take into account where the applicant’s head office is located.

Ownership and Group

In relation to the ownership and Group structure of an applicant, we may have regard to:

(a)

the applicant’s position within its group, including any other relationships that may exist between the applicant, controllers, associates and other persons that may be considered a close link;

(b)

the financial strength of the Group and its implications for the applicant;

(c)

whether the Group has a structure which makes it possible to:

(i)

exercise effective supervision;

(ii)

exchange information among regulators who supervise group members; and

(iii)

determine the allocation of responsibility among the relevant regulators;

(d)

any information provided by other regulators or third parties in relation to the applicant or any entity within its Group; and

(e)

whether the applicant or its group is subject to any adverse effect or considerations arising incorporation, establishment and operations of any member of its group. In considering these matters, we may also have regard to the type and level of regulatory oversight in the relevant country or countries of the group members and the regulatory infrastructure and adherence to internationally held conventions.

Controllers

In relation to the controllers of an applicant, we may, taking into account the nature, scale and complexity of the firm's business and organisation, have regard to:

(a)

the background, history and principal activities of the applicant’s controllers, including that of the controller's directors, partners or other officers associated with the applicant, and the degree of influence that they are, or may be, able to exert over the applicant and/or its activities;

(b)

where the Controller will exert significant management influence over the applicant, the reputation and experience of the controller or any individual within the controller;

(c)

the financial strength of a controller and its implications for the applicant’s ability to ensure the sound and prudent management of its affairs, in particular where a controller agrees to contribute any funds or other financial support such as a guarantee or a debt subordination agreement in favour of the Firm or Recognised Body; and

(d)

whether the applicant is subject to any adverse effect or considerations arising from the country or countries of incorporation, establishment or operations of a controller. In considering such matters, we may have regard to, among other things, the type and level of regulatory oversight, which the controller is subject to in the relevant country or countries and the regulatory infrastructure and adherence to internationally held conventions and standards.
