Step 3: Mitigating and aggravating factors

We may increase or decrease the amount of the financial penalty arrived at after Step 2 (excluding any amount to be disgorged as set out in Step 1), to take into account factors which aggravate or mitigate the contravention. Any such adjustments will generally be made by way of a percentage adjustment to the figure determined at Step 2.

The following list of factors may have the effect of aggravating or mitigating the

contravention:

(a)

the conduct of the firm in bringing (or failing to bring) quickly, effectively and completely the contravention to our attention (or the attention of other regulatory authorities, where relevant);

(b)

the degree of cooperation the firm showed during the investigation of the contravention by us, or any other regulatory authority allowed to share information with us;

(c)

where the firm's senior management were aware of the contravention or of the potential for a contravention, whether they took any steps to stop the contravention, and when these steps were taken;
