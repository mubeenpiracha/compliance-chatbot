 may not comply with an administrative requirement to pay restitution; in those cases we may consider that the sanction for breach of a Court Order may be needed to ensure compliance.

In determining the amount of restitution to seek or require, we may use our powers to require information and documents to enable us to determine the amount of profits made and/or losses suffered or any other adverse effects resulting from the conduct of the relevant person.

As well as obtaining information through our power to require information and documents described above, we may consider using our power in section 203 of FSMR to require a report prepared by a Skilled Person for the purposes of assisting us in exercising our restitution powers. For example, a Skilled Personâ€™s report may be used to:

(c)

determine how any amounts to be paid by the relevant person are to be distributed between persons.

7.12 Winding-up

We may apply to the Court for the winding up of a Company which is, or has been, an Authorised Person or Recognised Body, or operating in breach of the General Prohibition, where we consider it is just and equitable in the interests of the ADGM, in accordance with section 244 of FSMR.

In deciding whether such an application is just and equitable in the interests of the

ADGM, we will consider all relevant circumstances, including:

(a)

whether the Company has operated in accordance with FSMR and Rules;

(b)

where the Company has contravened FSMR or Rules:

(i)

the nature, scale and seriousness of the contravention;

(ii)

whether the contravention is ongoing;

(iii)

whether the contravention affects, or has the potential to affect, our objectives;

(iv)

what other steps the Company could take or other orders a Court could make to remedy the contravention;

(c)

the need to protect a firm's Clients (particularly in cases where an Authorised Person holds or controls Client Assets) other market participants, and/or the integrity of the market;

(d)

whether the needs of those operating in the ADGM and the interests of the ADGM are best served by the Company ceasing to operate;

(e)

in the case of an Authorised Person, where we consider that a Financial Services Permission should be withdrawn or, where it has been withdrawn, the extent to which there is other business that the firm carries on without Authorisation;

(f)

whether there is reason to believe that the firm or individual is or has been involved in financial crime or other criminal conduct;

(g)

where there is a significant cross-border or international element to the business being carried on by the Company, the impact on the business in other

jurisdictions and whether another law enforcement agency or regulatory authority can adequately address the matter; or

(h)

the extent to which the Company has co-operated with us.

7.13

Injunctions in cases of Market Abuse

Section 238 of FSMR provides that the Court, upon our application, may make an order

restraining Market Abuse if there is a reasonable likelihood that:

(a)

any person will engage in Market Abuse; or

(b)

is or has engaged in Market Abuse and that there is a reasonable likelihood that the Market Abuse will continue or be repeated,

irrespective of whether a contravention has occurred.

Upon our application, the Court may also make an order requiring a person to take any steps to remedy any Market Abuse that has occurred, and to restrain a person that may be engaged or have been engaged in any Market Abuse from dealing in any of their assets.

We may seek a range of orders from the Court, including an order:

(a)

requiring that trading in any Investments cease, either permanently or for such period as is specified in the order;

(b)

requiring that a disclosure be made to the market;

(c)

prohibiting a person from making offers of Securities in or from the ADGM; or

(d)

prohibiting a person from being involved in Reporting Entities, Listed Funds or Securities within the ADGM.

Before we make an application for an order (whether
