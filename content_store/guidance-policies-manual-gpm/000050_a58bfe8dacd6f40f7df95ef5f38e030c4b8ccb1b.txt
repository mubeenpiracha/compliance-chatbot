informing the affected person what rights of review that person has in respect of our decision, and within what period those rights of review must be exercised; and

(i)

having in place adequate mechanisms to enable the affected person to have our decision properly and impartially reviewed.

In certain circumstances we do not have to give an affected person advance notice of our proposed action, or the chance to make prior representations, before the action takes effect. In such circumstances, we are still obliged to give the affected person a right of representation within a specified period from the date on which the decision is made and

communicated to the affected person. We are obliged to consider any representations made by, or on behalf of, the affected person during that period. Decisions that might be made without giving the affected person a right to make representations before the decision takes effect include:

(a)

the exercise of our Own-Initiative Powers, applying the procedures in sections 42 and 124C of FSMR;

(b)

variation of Approval under section 48 of FSMR;

(c)

discontinuance or suspension of Listing of any Securities under section 53 of FSMR;

(d)

the issuing of a stop order under section 71 of FSMR; and

(e)

suspension of a Listed Entity's Securities from the Official List under section 180 of FSMR,

Where a right to make representations is exercised by an affected Person, we will communicate to the affected person whether we confirm our original decision, or otherwise we vary or withdraw that decision, given the representations made.

Where no representations are made by, or on behalf of, the affected person during the

relevant period, our original decision will remain in effect and will be confirmed.

Categories of decisions

The decisions which are made by us fall into the following categories:

(a)

decisions which are subject to the procedures in Part 21 of FSMR ("Part 21 Decisions"), e.g., a decision to impose a financial penalty, suspend or cancel a Financial Services Permission of an Authorised Person or Approval of an Approved Person, or exercise any of the powers set out in section 246 of FSMR;

(b)

decisions which are not subject to the procedures set out in Part 21 of FSMR ("Non-Part 21 Decisions"), e.g., exercise of certain Own-Initiative Powers, revocation of a Recognition Order, objection to a new Controller of an Authorised Person;

(c)

decisions under the Tax Reporting Regulations which are subject to the procedures specified in the relevant regulations (see Chapter 11); and

(d)

routine operational decisions that do not affect the rights, interests and liabilities of a person ("Operational Decisions"), e.g., a decision to commence an investigation against a person.

9.5

Part 21 Decisions

Where we propose to exercise any of our powers as set out in section 246(1) of FSMR, we must follow the procedure set out in Part 21 of FSMR. In order to facilitate a consistent approach to decision-making, Part 21 of FSMR sets out the steps we are required to follow in relation to Part 21 Decisions.
