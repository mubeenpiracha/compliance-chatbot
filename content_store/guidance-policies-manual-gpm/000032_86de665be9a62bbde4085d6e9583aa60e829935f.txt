 plays an important role in the pursuit of our objectives set out in FSMR. By imposing financial penalties, public censures and other disciplinary measures we show that we are upholding regulatory standards and helping to maintain market confidence and deter financial crime. It demonstrates the benefits of compliance and reassures others that effective compliance is warranted.

However, they are not the only tools available to us, and there will be instances of non- compliance which we consider appropriate to address without the use of such tools. The FSRA will adopt a risk-based approach when considering what tools to use.

Step 5 - Assessment of remedies

At the conclusion of an investigation, based on analysis of the information gathered and the Investigatorâ€™s findings, we may elect to take no further action or to pursue one or more of the remedies available.

There is a range of remedies which we may pursue to achieve our objectives. Our approach to the various remedies available and settlement is detailed in Chapter 7.

We do not have criminal jurisdiction. Should criminal conduct be identified, it will be

referred to the appropriate law enforcement agency.

6.10 Return of information and documents

Where, during the course of an investigation, we have obtained original documents, we will usually return those to the person from whom the documents were received, as soon as practicable after the conclusion of the investigation or related proceedings.

Where information or documents have been produced to us in the course of an investigation to assist another regulator or agency, we may release the information or documents to that other regulator or agency. Any original documents will usually be returned to the person from whom the documents were received, as soon as practicable after receiving them back from the other regulator or agency.

6.11 Costs

Where a person is found by the Appeals Panel or the Court to have contravened FSMR or Rules, the Appeals Panel or the Court may order that person to pay or reimburse us in respect of the whole or a specified part of the costs and expenses of the investigation, including the remuneration of a person involved in the investigation.
