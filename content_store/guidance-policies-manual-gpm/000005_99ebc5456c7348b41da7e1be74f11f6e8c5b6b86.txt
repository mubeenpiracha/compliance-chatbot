 contribute any funds or other financial support such as a guarantee or a debt subordination agreement in favour of the Firm or Recognised Body; and

(d)

whether the applicant is subject to any adverse effect or considerations arising from the country or countries of incorporation, establishment or operations of a controller. In considering such matters, we may have regard to, among other things, the type and level of regulatory oversight, which the controller is subject to in the relevant country or countries and the regulatory infrastructure and adherence to internationally held conventions and standards.

Where we have any concerns relating to the fitness and propriety of an applicant for a Financial Services Permission stemming from a Controller of such a person, we may consider imposing conditions on the Financial Services Permission designed to address such concerns. For example, we may impose, in the case of a start-up, a condition that there should be a shareholder agreement that implements an effective shareholder dispute resolution mechanism.

Resources, systems and controls

We will have regard to whether the applicant has sufficient resources, including the

appropriate systems and controls, such as:

(a)

the applicant’s financial resources and whether it complies, or will comply, with all applicable legislation, and whether the applicant appears to be in a position to be able to comply with such legislation;

(b)

the extent to which the applicant is or may be able to secure additional capital in a form acceptable to us where this appears likely to be necessary at any stage in the future;

(c)

the availability of sufficient competent human resources to conduct and manage the applicant’s affairs, in addition to the availability of sufficient Approved Persons to conduct and manage the applicant’s activities;

(d)

whether the applicant has sufficient and appropriate systems and procedures in order to support, monitor and manage its affairs, resources and regulatory obligations in a sound and prudent manner;

(e)

whether the applicant has appropriate anti-money laundering procedures and systems designed to ensure full compliance with applicable money laundering and counter terrorism legislation, and relevant UN Security Council and applicable sanctions and resolutions, including arrangements to ensure that all relevant staff are aware of their obligations;

(f)

the impact of other members of the applicant’s group on the adequacy of the applicant's resources and, in particular though not exclusively, the extent to which the applicant is or may be subject to consolidated prudential supervision by us or another regulatory authority;

(g)

whether the applicant is able to provide sufficient evidence about the source of funds available to it, to our satisfaction. This is particularly relevant in the case of a start-up entity; and

(h)

the matters specified in paragraph 2.2.8(c).

Firms: Collective suitability of individuals or other persons connected to the firm

2.2.12 Although individuals performing Controlled Functions are required to be Approved Persons, and a firm is required to appoint certain Approved Persons to certain functions, we will also consider:

(a)

the collective suitability of all of the firm's staff taken together, and whether there is a sufficient range of individuals with appropriate knowledge, skills and experience to understand, operate and manage the firm's affairs in a sound and prudent manner;

(b)

the composition of the Governing Body of the firm. The factors that would be taken into account by us in this context include, depending on the nature, scale and complexity of the firm's business and its organisational structure, whether:

(i)

the Governing Body has a sufficient number of members with relevant knowledge, skills and expertise among them to provide effective leadership, direction and oversight of the firm's business. For this purpose, the members of the Governing Body should be able to demonstrate that they have, and would continue to maintain, including through training, the necessary skills, knowledge and understanding of the firm's business to be able to fulfil their roles;

(ii)

the individual members of the Governing Body have the commitment necessary to fulfil their roles, demonstrated, for example, by a sufficient allocation of time to the affairs of the firm and reasonable limits on the number of memberships held by them in other boards of directors or similar positions. In particular, we will consider whether membership of other boards of directors or similar positions held by individual members

of the Governing Body has the potential to conflict with the interests of the firm and its customers and stakeholders;

(iii)

there is a sufficient number of independent members on the Governing Body;

(c)

the position of
