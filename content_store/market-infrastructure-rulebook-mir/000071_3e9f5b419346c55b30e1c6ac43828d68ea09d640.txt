Guidance

When determining whether it has made satisfactory arrangements for the safeguarding and administration of assets belonging to the users of its facilities, a Recognised Body should have regard to:

(a)

the level of protection which the arrangements provide against the risk of theft or other types or causes of loss;

(b)

whether the arrangements ensure that assets are only used or transferred in accordance with the instructions of the owner of those assets or in accordance with the terms of the agreement by which the Recognised Body undertook to safeguard and administer those assets;

(c)

whether the arrangements ensure that the assets are not transferred to the Recognised Body or to any other Person to settle the debts of the owner (or other Person with the appropriate rights over the assets) except in accordance with valid instructions from a Person entitled to give those instructions, or in accordance with the terms of the agreement by which the Recognised Body undertook to safeguard and administer those assets;
