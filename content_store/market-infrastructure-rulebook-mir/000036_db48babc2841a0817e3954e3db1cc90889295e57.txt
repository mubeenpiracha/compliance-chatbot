 Rule 4.7.16(b) at least on a two-monthly basis, unless more frequent analysis is warranted because the Investments cleared or markets served display high volatility, become less liquid, or when the size or concentration of positions held by its participants increase significantly;

perform a full validation of its risk-management models at least annually.

respect to any of their obligations to the Recognised Clearing House. Such Clearing Rules, Default Rules and procedures should:

(a)

address how any potentially uncovered credit losses would be allocated, including the repayment of any funds the Recognised Clearing House may borrow from its liquidity providers; and

(b)

indicate the Recognised Clearing House's process to replenish any financial resources that it may employ during a stress event, so that it can continue to operate in a safe and sound manner.

Liquidity risk

4.7.22

A Recognised Clearing House must:

(a)

determine the amount of its minimum liquid resources;

(b)

maintain sufficient liquid resources to be able to effect same-day, intra-day or multi-day settlement, as applicable, of its payment obligations with a high degree of confidence under a wide range of potential stress scenarios;

(c)

ensure that all resources held for the purposes of meeting its minimum liquid resource requirement are available when needed;

(d)

have a well-documented rationale to support the amount and form of total liquid resources it maintains for the purposes of (b) and (c); and

(e)

have appropriate arrangements in order to be able to maintain, on an on-going basis, such amount and form of its total liquid resources.

4.7.23

A Recognised Clearing House must have a robust framework for managing its liquidity risks.

For that purpose, the framework must, at a minimum, include:

(a)

Clearing Rules, Default Rules and procedures that:

MIR VER10.290725

address unforeseen and potentially uncovered liquidity shortfalls to avoid unwinding, revoking, or delaying the settlement of its payment obligations arising under the same-day, intra-day or multiday settlement obligations, as applicable; and

indicate any liquidity resources the Recognised Clearing House may deploy, in the event of default by a Member or other involved parties, during a stress event to replenish the available liquid resources and the associated process, so that it can continue to operate in a safe and sound manner;

(b)

effective operational and analytical tools to identify, measure and monitor its settlement and funding flows on an on-going and timely basis; and

(c)

rigorous due diligence procedures relating to its liquidity providers to obtain a high degree of confidence that each provider (whether the provider is a Member or other participant using its facilities or an external party) has:

sufficient information to assess, understand and manage its own liquidity risks; and

the capacity to perform as required under their commitment.

4.7.24

The framework referred to in Rule 4.7.23 must enable the Recognised Clearing House to effectively measure, monitor, and manage its liquidity risk.
