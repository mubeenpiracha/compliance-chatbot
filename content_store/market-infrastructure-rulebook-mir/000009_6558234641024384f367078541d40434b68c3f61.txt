Performance of Regulatory Functions

2.5.5

A Recognised Body must take all reasonable steps to ensure that the performance of its Regulatory Functions is not adversely affected by its commercial interests.

2.5.6

For the purposes of Rule 2.5.5, a Recognised Body must have adequate systems and controls, including policies and procedures, to ensure that the pursuit of its commercial interests (including its profitability) does not adversely impact on the performance of its Regulatory Functions.

Guidance

A Recognised Body should have systems for identifying, and drawing to the attention of its Senior Management and Governing Body, situations where its commercial interests conflict, or may potentially conflict, with the proper performance of its Regulatory Functions. This would enable the Recognised Body to take appropriate steps to ensure that such conflicts do not adversely affect the proper performance by the Recognised Body of its Regulatory Functions. In particular, the Recognised Body should ensure that adequate human, financial and other resources (both in terms of quantity and quality) are provided for risk management, regulatory supervision, compliance and other similar functions.

2.6

Operational systems and controls

2.6.1

A Recognised Body must establish a robust operational risk management framework with appropriate systems and controls to identify, monitor and manage operational risks that key participants, other Recognised Bodies, group and external service providers and utility providers might pose to itself.

2.6.2

A Recognised Body must have a business continuity plan, which is subjected to periodic review and scenario testing, that addresses events posing a significant risk

16

MIR VER10.290725

of disrupting operations, including events that could cause a widespread or major disruption. The plan should:

(a)

outline objectives, policies, procedures and responsibilities to deal with internal and external business disruptions and measures to ensure timely resumption of service levels;

(b)

include policies and procedures for event and crisis management;

(c)

incorporate the use of a secondary site;

(d)

contain appropriate emergency rules for force majeure events;

(e)

be designed to ensure that critical information technology systems can resume operations within two hours following disruptive events;

(f)

outline business continuity procedures in respect of its Members and other users of its facilities following disruptive or force majeure events; and

(g)

in the case of a Recognised Clearing House, be designed to enable the Recognised Clearing House to complete settlement by the end of the day of disruption, even in case of extreme circumstances.

2.6.3

A Recognised Body must have an incident management procedure in place to record, report, analyse and resolve all operational incidents.

2.6.4

A Recognised Body must have clearly defined operational reliability objectives and policies to achieve these objectives, as well as a scalable operational capacity adequate to handle increasing stress volumes, service-level objectives and historical data.

2.6.5

A Recognised Body must have a comprehensive physical and information security policy, standards, practices and controls to identify, assess and manage security threats and vulnerabilities and to protect data from loss and leakage, unauthorised access and other processing risks.

2.7

Transaction recording

2.7.1

The Recognised Body must ensure that satisfactory arrangements are made for recording transactions effected on or cleared (or to be cleared) by the Recognised Body by means of its facilities.

2.7.2

[Deleted]

Guidance

When determining whether it has satisfactory arrangements for recording the transactions effected on, or cleared, or to be cleared, by means of, its facilities, a Recognised Body should have regard to:

17

MIR VER10.290725

(a)

its arrangements for creating, maintaining and safeguarding an audit trail of transactions for at least 7 years; and

(b)

the type of information recorded and the extent to which the record includes details for each transaction of:

the name of the Financial Instrument (and, if relevant, the underlying asset) and the price, quantity and date of the transaction;

the identities and, where appropriate, the roles of the counterparties to the transaction;

if its rules make provision for transactions to be effected, cleared or to be cleared in more than one type of facility, or under more than one part of its rules, the type of facility in which, or the part of its rules under which, the transaction was effected, cleared or to be cleared; and
