The Regulator will not usually consider a complaint which has not, in the first instance, been made to the Recognised Body concerned, unless there is good reason for believing that it is a relevant complaint which merits early consideration by the Regulator.

6.4.5

When it is considering a relevant complaint, the Regulator will make its own enquiries as appropriate with the Recognised Body, the complainant and other Persons. It will usually ask the Recognised Body and the complainant to comment upon any preliminary or draft conclusions of its review and to confirm any matters of fact at that stage.

6.4.6

The Regulator will communicate the outcome of its review of a relevant complaint to the complainant and the Recognised Body, but will normally only discuss any action which it considers the Recognised Body should take with the Recognised Body itself.
