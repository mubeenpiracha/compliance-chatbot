The Rules relating to the form and method of notification in Rule 5.2 also apply to Remote Bodies.

Waivers

Remote Bodies may apply to the Regulator for a waiver of any of the notification rules. The procedure is the same as that for applications from Recognised Bodies, as set out in Rule 5.3.1.

Powers to supervise

7.5.1

The Regulator has similar powers to supervise Non-Abu Dhabi Global Market Recognised Bodies to those it has to supervise Recognised Bodies. It may (in addition to any other powers it might exercise) exercise any of the following powers:

110

MIR VER10.290725

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

7.5.2

give directions to a Remote Body if it has failed, or is likely to fail, to satisfy the Non-Abu Dhabi Global Market Recognition Requirements or if it has failed to comply with any other obligation imposed by or under FSMR and the Rules;

revoke a Recognition Order if a Remote Body is failing, or has failed, to comply with the Remote Recognition Requirements or any other obligation in or under FSMR and the Rules;

require a Remote Body or a Person connected with the Remote Body, to provide or produce specified information or information of a specified description, at a specified place and before the end of a reasonable period, in such form and with such verifications or authentications as it may reasonably require; or

require any of the following Persons, to provide the Regulator with a report on any matter, or appoint a Skilled Person to provide the Regulator with information or produce documents with respect to any matter:

the Remote Body;

any other Member of the Remote Body's Group;

a partnership of which the Remote Body is a Member; or

a Person who has at any time been a Person falling within (i), (ii) or (iii).

The Regulator will follow the approach in Rules 6.2.1, 6.6.1, 6.8.1, 6.9.6 and GEN 8.12 if it is considering exercising these powers in relation to a Remote Body.
