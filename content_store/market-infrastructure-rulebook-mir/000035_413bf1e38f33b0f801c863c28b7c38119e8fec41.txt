Guidance

1.

A Recognised Clearing House may be conducting its activities in multiple jurisdictions in circumstances such as:

(a)

where it operates through linked Recognised Clearing Houses in or outside of ADGM, or clearing houses, securities settlement systems, being systems that enable Financial Instruments to be transferred and settled by book entry, or central securities depositories outside of ADGM;

(b)

where its Members and other participants are incorporated, located, or otherwise conducting business in jurisdictions outside ADGM; or

(c)

where any collateral provided is located or held in a jurisdiction outside ADGM.

4.7.13

[Deleted]

2.

A Recognised Clearing House should be able to demonstrate to the Regulator that the legal basis on which it operates, including in multiple jurisdictions, is well founded. This would include:

(a)

well-defined rights and obligations of the Recognised Clearing House, its Members and other users, including its service providers such as custodians and settlement banks, or would provide a mechanism by which such rights and obligations can be ascertained. This would enable the Recognised Clearing House to identify and address risks that arise from its operations involving such parties;

(b)

adequately addressing legal risks faced by a Recognised Clearing House, particularly where it operates in multiple jurisdictions including a situation where an unexpected application of a law or regulation may render a contract between itself and counterparty void or unenforceable, thereby leading to a loss; and

(c)

obtaining independent legal opinions as appropriate to its activities in order to form clear views about the legally binding nature of its contractual arrangements in the relevant jurisdictions. Such legal opinions should, to the extent practicable, confirm the enforceability of the Clearing Rules and procedures of the Recognised Clearing House in the relevant jurisdictions and be made available to the Regulator upon request.

Credit risk

4.7.14

A Recognised Clearing House must establish and implement a robust process to manage:

(a)

its current and potential future credit and market risk exposures to market counterparties, including Members and other participants on its facilities; and

(b)

credit risks arising from its payment, Clearing, and settlement processes.

4.7.15

The process referred to in Rule 4.7.14 must:

(a)

enable a Recognised Clearing House to effectively measure, monitor, and manage its risks and exposures effectively;

(b)

enable a Recognised Clearing House to identify sources of credit risk and routinely measure and monitor its credit exposures; and

(c)

use appropriate risk management tools or margin and other prefunded financial resources to control the identified credit risks.

4.7.16

For the purposes of Rule 4.7.14, a Recognised Clearing House must, on a regular basis as appropriate to the nature, scale and complexity of its operations:

(a)

perform stress tests using models containing standards and predetermined parameters and assumptions; and

(b)

carry out comprehensive and thorough analysis of stress testing models, scenarios, and underlying parameters and assumptions used to ensure that they are appropriate for determining the required level of default protection in light of current and evolving market conditions.

4.7.17

A Recognised Clearing House must:

(a)

undertake the analysis referred to in Rule 4.7.16(b) at least on a two-monthly basis, unless more frequent analysis is warranted because the Investments cleared or markets served display high volatility, become less liquid, or when the size or concentration of positions held by its participants increase significantly;

(b)

consider carrying out daily stress testing to measure and monitor its risk exposures, especially if its operations are complex or widely spread over multiple jurisdictions; and

(c)

perform a full validation of its risk-management models at least annually.

4.7.18

A Recognised Clearing House must establish explicit Clearing Rules, Default
