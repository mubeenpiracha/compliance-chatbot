Public disclosure

3.7.1

Any arrangement to make information public shall satisfy the following conditions:

(a)

it must include all reasonable steps necessary to ensure that the information to be published is reliable, monitored continuously for errors, and corrected as soon as errors are detected;

46

MIR VER10.290725

(b)

it must facilitate the consolidation of the data with similar data from other sources; and

(c)

it must make the information available to the public on a non-discriminatory commercial basis at a reasonable cost.

3.7.2

For the purposes of Rule 3.7.1(a), a verification process should be established which does not need to be external from the organisation of the publishing entity, but which should be an independent cross-check of the accuracy of the information generated by the trading process. This process should have the capability to at least identify price and volume anomalies, be systematic and conducted in real-time. The chosen process should be reasonable and proportionate in relation to the business.
