 credit and liquidity exposures to its commercial settlement banks, including, to the extent such banks are also Members ensure that its legal agreements with such settlement banks, at a minimum:

specify clearly when transfers on the books of individual settlement banks are expected to occur and when they are final;

ensure that funds received are transferable as soon as possible, if not intra-day, at least by the end of the day to enable it and its Members and other participants on its facilities to manage their credit and liquidity risks; and

not permit such banks to combine or offset any right or liability they or their affiliates may have in their capacity as a Clearing Member.

4.8.3

If a Recognised Clearing House does not conduct its money settlement on commercial bank money but on its own books, it should minimise and strictly control its credit and liquidity risks as appropriate.

4.9

Physical delivery

4.9.1

A Recognised Clearing House incurring obligations that require physical delivery of physical instruments or commodities must:

(a)

provide adequate information to its Members and other participants using its facilities relating to its obligations with respect to physical delivery of the physical instruments or commodities. Such information must also be made publicly available;

(b)

identify, monitor, and manage the risks associated with such physical deliveries; and

(c)

identify, monitor, and manage the risks and costs associated with the storage and delivery.

4.9.2

A Recognised Clearing House must have adequate arrangements, including service agreements, which enable it to meet its physical delivery obligations.

Guidance

1.

Where a Recognised Clearing House matches participants that have delivery and receipt obligations, the Recognised Clearing House would not need to be involved with the physical storage and delivery process but it should monitor the participants' performance and to the extent practicable, ensure the participants have the necessary systems and resources to be able to fulfil their physical delivery obligations.

2.

The legal obligations for delivery should be clearly expressed in the Clearing Rules, Default Rules, and any related agreements, including provisions to specify, for instance:

(a)

whether the receiving participant should seek compensation from the Recognised Clearing House or the delivering participant in the event of a loss; and

(b)

if the Recognised Clearing House holds margin on the matched participants, such margin will only be released until the Recognised Clearing House confirms that both participants have fulfilled their obligations.

4.10

Collateral and margin

4.10.1

A Recognised Clearing House must call and receive collateral to manage its risks arising in the course of or for the purposes of its payment, Clearing, and settlement processes. It must, in the normal course of business, only accept collateral with low credit, liquidity, and market risks.

Guidance

In some instances, certain types of assets which are not considered to have low credit, liquidity and market risks may be acceptable for credit purposes if the Recognised Clearing House sets and enforces appropriately conservative haircuts and concentration limits and appropriate collateral risk management procedures are put in place by the Recognised Clearing House. A Recognised Clearing House may, in some circumstances, accept the deliverable of a contract as collateral against the contract for exchange.

4.10.3

A Recognised Clearing House must, for the purposes of meeting the requirement in Rule 4.10.1, establish and implement a collateral management system that is well designed and operationally flexible to enable ongoing monitoring and management of collateral. A Recognised Clearing House must also ensure that it is confident of the collateral's value in the event of liquidation and its capacity to use that collateral quickly, especially in stressed market conditions. Such a system must, at a minimum:

(a)

allow for timely calculation and execution of margin calls, accurate daily reporting of initial and variation margin, and the management of any disputes;

(b)

track the extent of reuse of collateral by the Recognised Clearing House (both cash and non-cash) and the rights of the Recognised Clearing House to the collateral;

(c)

accommodate timely deposit, withdrawal, substitution and liquidation of collateral;

(d)

regularly adjust its requirements for acceptable collateral in accordance with changes in underlying risks;

(e)

establish prudent valuation practices, including daily marking to market of the Recogn
