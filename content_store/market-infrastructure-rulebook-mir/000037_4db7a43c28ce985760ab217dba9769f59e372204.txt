-going and timely basis; and

(c)

rigorous due diligence procedures relating to its liquidity providers to obtain a high degree of confidence that each provider (whether the provider is a Member or other participant using its facilities or an external party) has:

sufficient information to assess, understand and manage its own liquidity risks; and

the capacity to perform as required under their commitment.

4.7.24

The framework referred to in Rule 4.7.23 must enable the Recognised Clearing House to effectively measure, monitor, and manage its liquidity risk.

4.7.25

To the extent that the Clearing Rules addressing liquidity risk referred to in Rule 4.7.23 also address credit risks, the same Clearing Rules, after adjustment as appropriate, can be used for both purposes.

4.7.26

A Recognised Clearing House must regularly:

(a)

review the adequacy of the amount of its minimum liquid resources as determined in accordance with Rule 4.7.22;

(b)

test the sufficiency of its liquid resources maintained to meet the relevant amount through rigorous stress testing; and

(c)

test its procedures for accessing its liquid resources at a liquidity provider.

4.7.27

Guidance

1.

In conducting its stress testing, a Recognised Clearing House should consider:

(a)

a wide range of relevant scenarios including relevant peak historic price volatilities, shifts in other market factors such as price determinants and yield curves, multiple defaults over various time horizons, simultaneous pressures in funding and asset markets, and

66

MIR VER10.290725

a spectrum of forward-looking stress scenarios in a variety of extreme but plausible market conditions;

(b)

the design and operation of the Recognised Clearing House;

(c)

all entities that may pose material liquidity risks to the Recognised Clearing House (such as settlement banks, custodian banks, liquidity providers, and other involved entities); and

(d)

where appropriate, for price fluctuations during a multi-day period.

4.7.28

[Deleted]

2.

For the purposes of meeting the minimum liquid resource requirement referred to in Rule 4.7.22, a Recognised Clearing House's qualifying liquid assets/resources may include:

(a)

cash held in appropriate currencies at a central bank in its or other relevant jurisdiction, or at creditworthy commercial banks;

(b)

committed lines of credit;

(c)

committed foreign exchange swaps;

(d)

committed repos; and

(e)

highly marketable collateral held in custody and Investments that are readily available and convertible into cash with prearranged and highly reliable funding arrangements, even in extreme but plausible market conditions.

4.7.29

A Recognised Clearing House's access to a routine line of credit made available by a central bank in its or other relevant jurisdiction, to the extent that the Recognised Clearing House has collateral that is eligible for pledging to (or for conducting other appropriate forms of transactions with) the relevant central bank must comply with the following to count as liquid assets/resources:

(a)

a Recognised Clearing House must take account of what collateral is typically accepted by the relevant central bank as such assets may be more likely to be liquid in stressed circumstances, even if the Recognised Clearing House does not have access to a routine line of credit made available by a central bank; and

(b)

a Recognised Clearing House should not assume the availability of emergency central bank credit as a part of its liquidity plan.

4.7.30

67

MIR VER10.290725

Guidance

1.

A Recognised Clearing House may supplement its qualifying liquid resources with other forms of liquid resources; and such liquid resources should be in the form of assets that are likely to be saleable, or acceptable as collateral, for lines of credit, swaps, or repos on an ad hoc basis following a default, even if this cannot be reliably prearranged or guaranteed in extreme market conditions.

4.7.31

[Deleted]

2.

Where a Recognised Clearing House has access to a central bank lines of credit or accounts, payment services, or securities services, it should use those services as far as practicable, as such use is likely to enhance its ability to manage liquidity risk more effectively.

4.7.32

A Recognised Clearing House must have clear procedures to report the results of its stress tests
