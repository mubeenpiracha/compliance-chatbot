A Recognised Clearing House's arrangements for final settlement must:

(a)

ensure that, if intra-day or real-time settlement is not feasible, final settlement (of any payment, transfer instruction, or other obligation that has been submitted to and accepted by a Recognised Clearing House in accordance with its acceptance criteria) occurs at least by the end of the value date of the relevant transaction; and

(b)

clearly define the points:

at which the transfer instruction takes effect as having been entered into the system and when the final settlement occurs;

after which unsettled payments, transfer instructions, or other obligations may not be revoked by the parties to the underlying contract; and

(c)

prohibit the revocation by a Member, participant or other user of a transfer instruction from the point specified in accordance with sub-paragraph (b)(ii).
