and any previous negative direction will cease to have effect on the making or passing of any such order, award or appointment.

6.5.9

6.5.10

Where a Recognised Body has taken action either of its own accord or in response to a direction, the Regulator may direct it to do or not to do specific things subject to these being within the powers of the Recognised Body under its Default Rules. However,

(a)

where the Recognised Body is acting in accordance with a direction given by the Regulator to take action on the basis that failure to take action would involve undue risk to investors or other participants in the market, the Regulator will not direct it to do or not to do specific things which the Recognised Body has power to do under its Default Rules, unless the Regulator is satisfied that this will not impede or frustrate the proper and efficient conduct of the default proceedings; and

(b)

where the Recognised Body has taken action under its Default Rules without being directed to do so, the Regulator will not direct it to do or not to do specific things which the Recognised Body has power to do under its Default Rules, unless the Regulator is satisfied that:

the direction will not impede or frustrate the proper and efficient conduct of the default proceedings; or

the direction is necessary:

A.

having regard to the public interest in the stability of the ADGM Financial System;

B.

to facilitate a proposed or possible use of a power under COBS 16; or

C.

in connection with a particular exercise of a power under COBS 16.

MIR VER10.290725

(f)

an order appointing a provisional liquidator,

has been made or passed and the Recognised Body has not taken action under its Default Rules as a result of this event or of the matters giving rise to it, a Relevant Office Holder appointed in connection with the order, award or resolution may make an application to the Regulator.

6.5.12

The effect of such an application is to require the Recognised Body concerned to take action under its Default Rules or to require the Regulator to take action.

6.5.13

The procedure is that the Regulator must notify the Recognised Body of the application and unless the Recognised Body:

(a)

takes action under its Default Rules;

(b)

notifies the Regulator that it proposes to take action forthwith; or

(c)

is directed to take action by the Regulator,

within three Business Days after receipt of that notice section 268 of the Insolvency Regulations will not apply in relation to Market Contracts to which the Member or designated non-Member is a party or to anything done by the Recognised Body for the purpose of, or in connection with, the settlement of Market Contracts.
