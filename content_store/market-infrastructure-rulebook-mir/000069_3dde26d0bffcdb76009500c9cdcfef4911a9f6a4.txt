whether its rules enable it to disclose any information to the Regulator or other appropriate bodies involved in the detection, prevention or pursuit of Market Abuse or Financial Crime inside or outside ADGM; and

(b)

whether its arrangements, resources, systems, and procedures enable it to:

monitor the use made of its facilities so as to obtain information regarding possible patterns of normal, abnormal or improper use of those facilities;

detect possible instances of Market Abuse or Financial Crime, for example, by detecting suspicious patterns in the use of its facilities;

communicate information about Market Abuse or Financial Crime promptly and accurately to appropriate organisations; and
