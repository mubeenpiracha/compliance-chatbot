(f)

Financial Instruments which are subject to a restriction on transfer shall not be considered as freely negotiable unless the restriction is not likely to disturb the market.

Financial Instruments that are not fully paid may be considered as freely negotiable, if arrangements have been made to ensure that the negotiability of such Financial Instruments is not restricted and that adequate information concerning the fact that the Financial Instruments are not fully paid, and the implications of that fact for shareholders, is publicly available.

When exercising its discretion whether to admit a Financial Instrument to trading, a Recognised Investment Exchange shall, in assessing whether the Financial Instrument is capable of being traded in a fair, orderly and efficient manner, take into account the following:

the distribution of those Financial Instruments to the public; and

such historical financial information, information about the Issuer, and information providing a business overview as is required to be prepared under the Market Rules or is or will be otherwise publicly available.

A Financial Instrument that is admitted to the Official List, and the listing of which is not suspended, shall be deemed to be freely negotiable and capable of being traded in a fair, orderly and efficient manner.

When assessing whether a Financial Instrument is capable of being traded in a fair, orderly and efficient manner, the Recognised Investment Exchange shall take into account, whether the following criteria (if relevant to the particular kind of Financial Instrument) are satisfied:

the terms of the Financial Instrument are clear and unambiguous and allow for a correlation between its price and the price or other value measure of the underlying Financial Instrument;

the price or other value measure of the underlying Financial Instrument is reliable and publicly available;

there is sufficient information publicly available of a kind needed to value the Financial Instrument;

the arrangements for determining the settlement price of the Financial Instrument ensure that this price properly reflects the price or other value measure of the underlying; and

where the settlement of the Financial Instrument requires or provides for the possibility of the delivery of an underlying security or asset rather than cash settlement, there are adequate settlement and delivery procedures for that underlying as well as adequate arrangements to obtain relevant information about that underlying.

(a)

For an open-ended Collective Investment Fund:

the distribution of those Units to the public;

whether there are appropriate market-making arrangements, or the Fund Manager provides appropriate alternative whether arrangements for investors to redeem the Units; and

whether the value of the units is made sufficiently transparent to investors by means of the periodic publication of the net asset value.

(b)

For a closed-ended Investment Fund:

the distribution of those Units to the public; and

whether the value of the Units is made sufficiently transparent to information on the Fund's investors, either by publication of investment strategy or by the periodic publication of a net asset value.

3.9.4

Derivatives

When admitting to trading a Financial Instrument that is a Derivative, a Recognised Investment Exchange shall verify that the following conditions are satisfied:

(a)

the terms of the contract establishing the Derivative must be clear and unambiguous, and enable a correlation between the price of the Derivative and the price or other value measure of the underlying;

(b)

the price or other value measure of the underlying must be reliable and publicly available or ascertainable; or the contract establishing that instrument must be likely to provide a means of disclosing to the market, or enabling the market to assess, the price or other value measure of the underlying, where the price or value measure is not otherwise publicly available;

(c)

sufficient information of a kind needed to value the Derivative must be publicly available or ascertainable;

(d)

the arrangements for determining the settlement price of the contract must be such that the price properly reflects the price or other value measure of the underlying or reference;
