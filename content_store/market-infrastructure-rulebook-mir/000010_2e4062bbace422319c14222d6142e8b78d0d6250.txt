 and the extent to which the record includes details for each transaction of:

2.8.1

A Recognised Body must ensure that access to its facilities is subject to criteria designed to protect the orderly functioning of the market and the interests of investors.

2.8.2

The Recognised Body must make transparent and non-discriminatory rules, based on objective criteria, governing access to, or membership of, its facilities. In particular, those rules must specify the obligations for users or Members of its facilities arising from:

its professional standards for staff of any Authorised Person, or Remote Member, having access to or membership of a financial market operated by the Recognised Body;

Guidance

When assessing whether access to its facilities is subject to criteria designed to protect the orderly functioning of the market, or of those facilities, and the interests of investors, a Recognised Body should consider whether:

(a)

it limits access as a Member to such Persons:

over whom it can with reasonable certainty enforce its rules contractually;

who have sufficient technical competence to use its facilities;

whom it is appropriate to admit to membership having regard to the size and sophistication of users of its facilities and the nature of the business effected by means of, or cleared through, its facilities; and

(if appropriate) who have adequate financial resources in relation to their exposure to the Recognised Body;

(b)

indirect access to its facilities is subject to suitable criteria, remains the responsibility of a Member of the Recognised Body and is subject to its rules;

(c)

where access is granted to Remote Members, there are adequate safeguards against Market Abuse and Financial Crime; and

(d)

its rules:

set out the design and operation of the Recognised Body’s relevant systems;

19

MIR VER10.290725

set out the risk for Members and other participants when accessing and participating on the Recognised Body’s facilities;

contain provisions for the resolution of Members’ and other participants’ disputes and an appeal process for the decisions of the Recognised Body;

contain disciplinary proceedings, including any sanctions that may be imposed by the Recognised Body against its Members and other participants; and

any other matters necessary for the proper functioning of the Recognised Body and the facilities operated by it.
