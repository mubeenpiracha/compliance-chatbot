Guidance

1.

When determining whether its procedures for consulting Members and other users of its facilities are appropriate, a Recognised Body should have regard to the range of Persons to be consulted by it under those procedures. Consultation with a smaller range of Persons may be appropriate where limited, technical changes to a Recognised Body's rules are proposed. A Recognised Body's procedures may include provision to restrict consultation where it is essential to make a change to the rules without delay in order to ensure continued compliance with the Recognition Requirements or other legal obligations.

When determining whether its procedures for consulting Members and other users of its facilities are appropriate, a Recognised Body should have regard to the extent to which the procedures include:

(a)

informal discussions at an early stage with users of its facilities or appropriate representative bodies;

(b)

publication to users of its facilities of a formal consultation paper which includes clearly expressed reasons for the proposed changes and an appropriately detailed assessment of the likely costs and benefits;
