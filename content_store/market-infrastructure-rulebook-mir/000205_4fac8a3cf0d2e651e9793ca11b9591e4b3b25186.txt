Guidance

1.

Where a Recognised Clearing House matches participants that have delivery and receipt obligations, the Recognised Clearing House would not need to be involved with the physical storage and delivery process but it should monitor the participants' performance and to the extent practicable, ensure the participants have the necessary systems and resources to be able to fulfil their physical delivery obligations.

2.

The legal obligations for delivery should be clearly expressed in the Clearing Rules, Default Rules, and any related agreements, including provisions to specify, for instance:

(a)

whether the receiving participant should seek compensation from the Recognised Clearing House or the delivering participant in the event of a loss; and

(b)

if the Recognised Clearing House holds margin on the matched participants, such margin will only be released until the Recognised Clearing House confirms that both participants have fulfilled their obligations.
