RECOGNITION (REC)

Guidance

1. Recognised Members should note that conduct which occurs outside the DIFC is only Market Abuse under Part 6 of the Markets Law (and therefore subject to the notification requirement in Rule 3.4.5) if it affects DIFC markets or users of DIFC markets.

2. Further Guidance on the requirement to notify the DFSA of suspected Market Abuse can be found after GEN Rule 11.10.12A (the equivalent requirement for an Authorised Firm).
