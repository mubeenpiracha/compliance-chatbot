9.9.5 A Credit Rating Agency must publish sufficient information about its procedures, methodologies and assumptions (including financial statement adjustments that deviate materially from those contained in the issuer's published financial statements and a description of the rating committee process, if applicable) so that outside parties can understand how a rating was arrived at by the Credit Rating Agency. This information will include (but not be limited to) the meaning of each rating category and the definition of default or recovery, and the time horizon the Credit Rating Agency used when making a rating decision.

(a)

Where a Credit Rating Agency rates a structured finance product, it must provide investors and/or subscribers (depending on the Credit Rating Agency's business model) with sufficient information about its loss and cash-flow analysis so that an investor allowed to invest in the product can understand the basis for the Credit Rating Agency's rating. A Credit Rating Agency must also disclose the degree to which it analyses how sensitive a rating of a structured finance product is to changes in the Credit Rating Agency's underlying rating assumptions.
