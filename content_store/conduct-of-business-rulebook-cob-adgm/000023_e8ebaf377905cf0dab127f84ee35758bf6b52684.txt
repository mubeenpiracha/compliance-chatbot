4. Joint ventures may be in the form of contractual arrangements under which parties contribute their assets and expertise to develop or to undertake specified business activities. Where an Undertaking is set up by participants in such a joint venture for the purposes of their joint venture, the Undertaking itself can be treated as a Professional Client provided a joint venture partner meets the Professional Client criteria. To be able to rely on a joint venture partner's Professional Client status, such a partner should generally be a key decision maker with respect to the business activities of the joint venture, and not just a silent partner.

5. An Undertaking which meets the criteria to be a “deemed” Professional Client in accordance with the criteria in Rule 2.4.2 does not need to meet the criteria in this Rule to qualify as a Professional Client.
