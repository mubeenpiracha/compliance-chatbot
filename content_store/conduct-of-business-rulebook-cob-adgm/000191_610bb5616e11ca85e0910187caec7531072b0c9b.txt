8.6.5 Execution of orders on an OTF must be carried out on a discretionary basis.

8.6.6 An OTF Operator must exercise discretion only in the following circumstances:

(a)

when deciding to place or retract an order on the OTF they operate; and/or

(b)

when deciding not to match a specific Client order with other orders available in the systems at a given time, provided it is in compliance with specific instructions received from a Client and with its "best execution" obligations in accordance with these Rules.

8.6.7 With a system that crosses Client orders, the OTF Operator may decide if, when and how much of two or more orders it wants to match within the system. With regard to a system that arranges transactions in non-equities, the OTF Operator may facilitate negotiation between Clients so as to bring together two or more potentially compatible trading interests in a transaction.
