9.2.8 A Credit Rating Agency must establish and implement a rigorous and formal review function responsible for periodically reviewing the methodologies and models and significant changes to the methodologies and models it uses. Where feasible and appropriate for the size and scope of its credit rating services, this function must be independent of the business lines that are principally responsible for rating various classes of issuers and obligations.

9.2.9 A Credit Rating Agency must assess whether existing methodologies and models for determining credit ratings of structured finance products are appropriate when the risk characteristics of the assets underlying a structured finance product change materially. In cases where the complexity or structure of a new type of structured finance product or the lack of robust data about the assets underlying the structured finance product raise serious questions as to whether the Credit Rating Agency can determine a credible credit rating for the security, Credit Rating Agency must refrain from issuing a credit rating.
