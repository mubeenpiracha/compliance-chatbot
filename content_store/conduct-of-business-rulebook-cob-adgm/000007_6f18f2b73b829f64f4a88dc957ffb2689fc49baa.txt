Guidance

1.

The point at which a Person becomes a Client of an Authorised Person is a question of fact that needs to be addressed by the Authorised Person in light of the nature of the relevant Regulated Activity (or Specified Investment) involved, and the relations and interactions which the Authorised Person has with that Person.

2.

The Client classification must take place before an Authorised Person carries on a Regulated Activity where this involves provision of a service to a Client. However, this does not preclude marketing prior to such classification being documented and notified.

3.

The Regulator expects Authorised Persons to adopt practices which are consistent with the underlying intent of the client classification provisions, which is to provide Clients with an appropriate level of regulatory protection in light of the resources and expertise available to such Clients. Therefore, as soon as it is reasonably apparent that an Authorised Person is likely to carry on a Regulated Activity where this involves provision of a service to a potential Client, it should undertake the client classification process relating to that Person.
