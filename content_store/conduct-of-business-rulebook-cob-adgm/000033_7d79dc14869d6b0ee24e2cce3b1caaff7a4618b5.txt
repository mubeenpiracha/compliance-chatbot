If any gaps are identified between the requirements applicable to the Authorised Person under these Rules and the requirements under which the client classification is carried out by such other entity, the Authorised Person may rely on such a client classification only if it has effectively addressed the identified gaps.

Guidance

1.

Generally, an Authorised Person relying on this Rule should be able to demonstrate to the Regulator the due diligence process that it had undertaken to assess whether the client classification made by its head office or other branch of the same legal entity or a member of its Group substantially meets the client classification requirements in these Rules (e.g. documents verified and available) and, if any gaps are identified, how those gaps are effectively addressed.

2.

If an Authorised Person wishes to use any client classification undertaken by any third party other than its head office or another branch of the same legal entity, or a member of its Group, such an arrangement is generally treated as an outsourcing arrangement. In such case, the Authorised Person would need to meet the requirements in GEN 3.3.32 relating to outsourcing.
