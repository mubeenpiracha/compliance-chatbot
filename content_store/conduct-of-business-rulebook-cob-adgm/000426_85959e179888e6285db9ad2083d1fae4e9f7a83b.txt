19.21.2 (1)

This Rule applies where a Payment Order is initiated directly by the Payer.

(2)

The Payer’s Payment Service Provider is liable to the Payer for the correct execution of the Payment Transaction unless it can prove to the Payer and, where relevant, to the Payee’s Payment Service Provider, that the Payee’s Payment Service Provider received the amount of the Payment Transaction in accordance with Rule 19.15.2(1) and (2).

(3) Where the Payer’s Payment Service Provider is liable under (2), it must without undue delay refund to the Payer the amount of the non-executed or defective Payment Transaction and, where applicable, restore the debited Payment Account to the state in which it would have been had the defective Payment Transaction not taken place.
