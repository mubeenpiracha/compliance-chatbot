19.21.4 (1) Where a Payment Order is initiated by the Payer through a Payment Initiation Service Provider, the account servicing Payment Service Provider must refund to the Payer the amount of a non-executed or defective Payment Transaction and, where applicable, restore the debited Payment Account to the state in which it would have been had the defective Payment Transaction not taken place.

(2) Where the Payment Initiation Service Provider suffers a technical breakdown or other deficiency linked to the non-execution, defective or late execution of the Payment Transaction, (1) does not prevent the account servicing Payment Service Provider from seeking compensation from the Payment Initiation Service Provider for the losses incurred or sums paid as a result of the refund to the Payer.
