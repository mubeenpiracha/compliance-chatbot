For example, an Authorised Person is not expected to undertake advising or arranging activities relating to a Regulated Activity or Specified Investment which is suited to Professional Clients (e.g. complex derivatives) with a potential customer without having a reasonable basis to consider that such a customer has sufficient knowledge and experience relating to the relevant activity or product. Whilst a formal client classification may not be needed at the early stages of interaction, an Authorised Person is expected to form a reasonable view about the professional status of a potential Client when exposing such a customer to Regulated Activities or Specified Investment (such as investments in a Qualified Investor Fund) which are intended for Professional Clients.
