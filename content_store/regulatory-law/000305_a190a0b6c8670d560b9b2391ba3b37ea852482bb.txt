(a)

may refer to materials (instead of providing a copy) if they are already held by the Relevant Person or are publicly available; and

(a)

to make the proposed decision (either as proposed or with variations), then it must give the person a Decision Notice under paragraph 5; or

(b)

not to make the proposed decision, then it must as soon as practicable notify the person in writing that it has decided not to make the decision.
