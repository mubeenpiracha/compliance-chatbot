any money paid or property transferred by him under the agreement;

(b)

compensation reflecting any loss sustained by the relevant party as a direct result of such payment or transfer; and

(c)

compensation for an amount becoming due that is dependent upon a contingency occurring under the relevant agreement, provided that such contingency shall have occurred prior to the relevant party being notified by the other party or by the DFSA that the agreement has been entered into in breach of the Financial Services Prohibition, the Collective Investment Prohibitions or the Financial Promotions Prohibition.

(3)

If the relevant party chooses not to perform the agreement or, under Article 65(2), recovers money paid or property transferred by him under the agreement, he shall in turn repay any money or property he has received under the agreement.
