 a risk to Client Assets. As the investigation is ongoing, the DFSA would ordinarily expect not to publicise a temporary suspension under this power. But the DFSA retains discretion to publicise such a suspension in an individual case if it is appropriate to do so given the particular circumstances.

4. Under Article 98A(7) of the Regulatory Law, a Registered Auditor or Audit Principal may refer a decision of the DFSA to suspend or withdraw its registration to the FMT. The DFSA decision to suspend or withdraw registration remains in force until the review is concluded and the FMT makes a further order, unless the FMT has made an interim order to stay the decision.

5. Under Article 98A(3) of the Regulatory Law the DFSA may make Rules containing requirements a Registered Auditor or Audit Principal must meet before the DFSA will grant a request by the Registered Auditor or Audit Principal to withdraw registration.

6. An application by a Registered Auditor or Audit Principal to withdraw their registration does not in itself result in a withdrawal of the registration. Until the DFSA withdraws the registration, the Registered Auditor or Audit Principal remains subject to, and must comply with, the Regulatory Law, Rules and any other relevant legislation administered by the DFSA.
