(3) For the purposes of assessing whether an applicant for registration meets the fit and

proper requirement under (1)(a), the DFSA may consider:

(a)

the application and submissions;

(b)

its background and history;

(c)

its ownership and Group structure;

(d)

its resources, including human and technological;

(e)

whether the applicantâ€™s affairs are likely to be conducted and managed in a sound and prudent manner; and

(f)

any other matter considered relevant by the DFSA.

(4) The DFSA will in assessing the matters in (1) and (3) consider the cumulative effect of factors which, if taken individually, may be regarded as insufficient to give reasonable cause to doubt the fitness and propriety of an applicant.
