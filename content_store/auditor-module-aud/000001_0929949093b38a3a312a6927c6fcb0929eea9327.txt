Guidance

1.

This section outlines the DFSA’s registration requirements for a Registered Auditor and an Audit Principal.

2.

Article 97C of the Regulatory Law prohibits a Person from providing any Audit Service to a Domestic Firm, Public Listed Company or Domestic Fund and from performing a substantial role in the provision by another person of Audit Services referred to in Article 97(d)(i), unless that person is registered by the DFSA as a Registered Auditor. In addition, a Registered Auditor must not permit any person to undertake any of the responsibilities of an Audit Principal unless that person is registered by the DFSA as an Audit Principal for that Registered Auditor.

3.

The DFSA considers that a person (“P”) will perform a “substantial role” in the provision by another person (“B”) of Audit Services under Article 97C of the Regulatory Law if, for example:

a.

a staff member of P has an extensive involvement in the provision of those Audit Services by B;

b.

a large number of P’s staff are involved (including under a secondment, or similar arrangement) in the provision of Audit Services by B; or

c.

P performs a quality management role in the general provision of Audit Services by B.

4.

The DFSA does not consider that a person providing any of the following activities or services would be performing a substantial role:

a.

services provided only on an individual audit engagement;

b.

the work of a component auditor participating in the group audit performed by a Registered Auditor;

c.

services typically provided by service delivery centres, provided these services are routine, repetitive or specialised tasks or otherwise administrative in nature; or

d.

third-party audit software platform services or any other non-audit related services.
