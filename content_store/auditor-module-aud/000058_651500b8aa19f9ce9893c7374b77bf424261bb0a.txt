Guidance

1.

The DFSA expects a Registered Auditor to implement policies and procedures under Rule 4.11.2 that are appropriate based on the nature, scale and complexity of the Registered Auditorâ€™s business. For example, a larger auditor is expected to have more detailed and comprehensive policies and procedures in place.

2.

The policies and procedures should:

a.

include internal arrangements to allow for reports to be made by whistleblowers;

b.

include adequate procedures to deal with, assess and, where appropriate, escalate reports to the senior management of the Registered Auditor or, if necessary, to the DFSA or to any other relevant authority;
