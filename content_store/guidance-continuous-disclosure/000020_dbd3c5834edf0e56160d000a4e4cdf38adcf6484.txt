 on an uninformed or false market basis.

27 The Listing Authority may impose a Suspension under Rule 2.6 to prevent a disorderly or uninformed market, or for a breach of Rule 7.5.1.

110) The Listing Authority does not expect a Reporting Entity to respond to every market rumour, in the (social) media or in analyst reports that concerns it. The Listing Authority, in particular, will generally not require the Reporting Entity to respond to the report/rumour, where the: report/rumour does not appear to be contributing to a significant change in the price and/or traded volume in the Listed Entity’s Securities, and

b) Reporting Entity convinces the Listing Authority that the report/rumour:

(i)

appears to be mere supposition or speculation; or

(ii)

simply confirms a matter that is generally understood by the market due to, for example, previous Disclosures by the Reporting Entity, or media/analyst commentary.

111) The Listing Authority does consider, however, that a Reporting Entity has a responsibility to respond to a report/rumour where it appears to contain, or is based on, credible Inside Information, whether it is accurate or not, and there is a significant impact on the price and/or traded volume of the Listed Entity’s Securities which coincides with the report/rumour.28 If the Reporting Entity does not respond to the report/rumour voluntarily, the Listing Authority will consider using its powers under Rule 7.5.1 to require it to do so.

112) Where the Listing Authority has concerns that a report/rumour has caused, or is likely to cause, a false market in a Listed Entity’s Securities, it will usually endeavour to contact the Reporting Entity to discuss the situation.29 In such circumstances, the Listing Authority will usually ask the Reporting Entity to confirm whether the report/rumour is accurate. When responding to this question, the Listing Authority expects the Reporting Entity to answer frankly and honestly, even if the report/rumour relates to information that the Reporting Entity considers confidential and not something that is required to be disclosed under Rule 7.2.2.30

113) Depending on the circumstances relating to a report/rumour, if the Listing Authority is concerned that there is, or is likely to be, a false market in the Listed Entity’s Securities and the Reporting Entity advises that:

28 This responsibility to respond may also occur in circumstances where the RIE’s market is not trading at the time, but the report/rumour is of a nature that when the RIE’s market opens for trading it is likely to have a significant impact on the price and/or traded volume of the Listed Entity’s Securities (as evidenced, for example, in the orders queued in the RIE’s trading system throughout a pre-open/pre- auction phase). 29 The Listing Authority encourages Reporting Entities to proactively contact the Listing Authority where a Reporting Entity becomes aware of a report/rumour that may lead to the development of a false market in the Listed Entity’s Securities. This is preferred over a Reporting Entity waiting to be contacted by the Listing Authority. Proactive contact by the Reporting Entity will allow the Listing Authority to provide guidance on whether there is, or may be, a false market, the scope of the Disclosure that the Reporting Entity may make to address the false market, and whether it would be appropriate for the Reporting Entity to request a Suspension. 30 A failure by the Reporting Entity to provide information to the Listing Authority may deny the Listing Authority the opportunity to assist the Reporting Entity in meeting its disclosure obligations under the Rules and FSMR. Refusing to answer a question from the Listing Authority will also constitute a breach of Rules 2.8.1 and 2.8.2. Answering dishonestly may constitute a breach of section 221 of FSMR.
