Guidance

The Stabilisation Manager may also often be the lead manager in respect of the same offer and therefore can over-allot Eligible Securities in the initial allocation and then facilitate the stabilisation by purchasing Eligible Securities during the Stabilisation Window. A Stabilisation Manager and his Stabilisation Agents may also sell short on the market to facilitate stabilisation or in order to close out or liquidate positions established by Price Stabilisation.
