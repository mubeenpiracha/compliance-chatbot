PRICE STABILISATION (PRS)

Guidance

This Rule allows a Person who is acting as a Stabilisation Manager in respect of a dual-listing of Eligible Securities to rely on this chapter or on the laws of Recognised Jurisdiction to conduct those activities. The Rule is designed to provide Stabilisation Managers with some limited flexibility in respect of their activities in the DIFC, so long as those activities are adequately regulated.
