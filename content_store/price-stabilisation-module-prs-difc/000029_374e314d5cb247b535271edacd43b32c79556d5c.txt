Guidance

1.

Rule 5.2.2 (e)(vi) acknowledges that some market structures, for example anonymous order books or anonymous indications of interest, cause the identity of counterparties to sometimes be unknown prior to the effecting of transactions.

2.

Rule 5.2.2 also accepts that some participants in the Price Stabilisation may have accrued uneconomic positions during stabilisation and therefore permits a single transaction, probably at the end-of day, to ‘square-off’ the positions between participants. The terms on which these transactions be carried may often be agreed in the terms of engagement between the Stabilisation Manager and his Stabilisation Agents. The DFSA may when inspecting records kept relating to stabilisation seek the rationale for any of these transactions and the price at which they were conducted.

5.2.3 The Stabilisation Manager must keep the register in the English language and keep it in a location that would allow for it, or a certified copy, to be available within a reasonable time to any person permitted by these Rules to inspect it.
