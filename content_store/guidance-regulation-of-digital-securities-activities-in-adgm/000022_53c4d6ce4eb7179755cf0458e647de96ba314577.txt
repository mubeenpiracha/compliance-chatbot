 In summary: a) the applicable fees for a Recognition Order as an RIE or an RCH are set out in FEES

Rule 3.7.1(a);

b) the fees for a FSP for an Authorised Person (other than a DSF) are set out in FEES

Rules 2.2.1(a) and 3.5; and

c) the fees for a DSF are as set out in paragraph 133 below.

132) For Digital Securities activities to be conducted by existing ADGM licenced intermediaries or MTFs:

a) For Authorised Persons seeking to expand their activities to include Digital Securities activities in relation to a different Regulated Activity, an application for an amendment to the scope to their existing FSP will need to be submitted. The applicable fees will be as set out in FEES Rule 3.8; and

b) For an Authorised Person intending to provide Regulated Activities in relation to Digital Securities within the scope of their existing FSP, no fees will apply, subject to paragraph (a) and paragraph 133 below, but firms are required to discuss this with their FSRA Supervision Relationship Manager as early as possible (as there may be wider fee or other supervisory implications).

for Providing Custody and a US$15,000 supplementary fee in accordance with FEES Rule 1.2.6, reflective of the regulatory burden imposed on FSRA to ensure compliance with the applicable Rules and requirements for conducting DSF related activities.

134) RIEs or RCHs with Recognitions Orders seeking to expand their activities to include Digital Securities activities: No additional fees will apply.

135) For MTFs (using Virtual Assets) upgrading to a Digital Securities RIE: For Authorised Persons operating an MTF and seeking to further operate as a Digital Securities RIE, it is unlikely that the FSRA would seek to impose the full RIE Recognition Order fee (being US $125,000), on the assumption that there is likely to be significant overlap in the systems, controls and technology used by the entity across both activities. The FSRA may instead impose a fee in the region of US$40,000 (dependent on the Applicant’s business model and any overlap/similarities in its technology, systems and controls). Supervision fees
