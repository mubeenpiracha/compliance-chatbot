4. Whether a Rep Office is acting outside the scope of its Licence is always a question of fact, which the DFSA will determine in the overall context of the activities of the Rep Office. The DFSA will take into account the indicators set out in the Guidance below when determining whether a Rep Office is acting within or outside the scope of its Licence. If a Rep Office undertakes activities which are considered outside the scope of its Licence, such activities would trigger appropriate regulatory action or could result in civil liability. How do Rep Office activities differ from ‘advising’?

5. While a Rep Office can give general information to potential customers about financial services or financial products of its related parties, it is prohibited from advising, for example conducting the Financial Service of ‘Advising on Financial Products’. A firm licensed to give advice can give advice and distribute general information about financial products and financial services whether or not such services or products are of a related party of the firm or otherwise.
