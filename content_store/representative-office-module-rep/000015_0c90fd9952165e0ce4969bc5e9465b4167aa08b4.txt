investment research or general market information.

REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE (REP)

How do Rep Office activities differ from ‘arranging’?

11. Many of the restrictions noted above apply in this context. A Rep Office can introduce or refer potential customers to a related party that provides financial products or financial services. In contrast, a firm licensed to conduct arranging activities i.e. Arranging Deals in Investments, Arranging Credit and Advising on Credit, Arranging Custody and Insurance Intermediation (referred to here as an ‘arranging firm’) can make such introductions or referrals to financial product or financial service providers, without such a provider having to be a related party of the arranging firm.
