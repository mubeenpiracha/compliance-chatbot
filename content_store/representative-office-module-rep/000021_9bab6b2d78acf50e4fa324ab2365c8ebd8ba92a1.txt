Third-party products distributed by a Rep Officeâ€™s related parties

14. A Rep Office is prohibited from marketing financial products offered by a third party unrelated to it, even if such a third party has an agreement with a related party of the Rep Office to distribute/market such products. For example, if a Group member of the Rep Office is an arranger or a brokerage firm, the Rep Office cannot market any third party financial products which the related arranger or brokerage firm can distribute/market. This is because the financial product belongs to an unrelated third party, and the financial service itself of the related party, which the Rep Office can market, does not extend to the activities which the related party can carry out under its own authorisation/Licence. The Rep Office can only make introductions or referrals to the arranging or brokerage firm which is related to it. Related parties of a Rep Office located in the DIFC
