Guidance

1.

Under Rule 1.1.1(2), the principles apply, unless otherwise stated, only to the Representative Office in its capacity as a branch in the DIFC and not to the institution as a whole.

2.

The Principles for Representative Offices have the status of Rules and are a general statement of fundamental regulatory requirements which apply alongside the other Rules and also in new or unforeseen situations which may not be covered elsewhere by a specific Rule. Rules in other areas of this module or the Rulebook build upon these fundamental principles. Consequently the Rules and Guidance elsewhere should not be seen as exhausting the implications of the Principles.

3.

Breaching a Principle for Representative Offices makes a Representative Office liable to disciplinary action, and may indicate that it is no longer fit and proper to carry on a Financial Service or to hold a Licence and the DFSA may consider withdrawing authorisation or the Licence on that basis.

4.

The onus will be on the DFSA to show that the Representative Office has been at fault in some way, taking into account the standard of conduct required under the Principle in question.
