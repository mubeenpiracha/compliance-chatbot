c.

not be able to ‘place’ or ‘assist’ in the placing of reinsurance business with (as opposed to making referrals to) reinsurers in the DIFC through a related party that is offering reinsurance brokerage services to cedants, because such activities also go beyond either or both permitted activities of a Rep Office. For placing, or assisting in that process, the DIFC entity needs an Insurance Intermediation Licence, not a Rep Office Licence.
