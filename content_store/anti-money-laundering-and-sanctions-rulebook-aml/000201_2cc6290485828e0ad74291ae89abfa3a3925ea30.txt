The Regulator expects compliance by Authorised Persons and Recognised Bodies with ‘FATF Recommendation Number 15’, FATF’s Interpretative Note (R.15/INR.15) and ‘FATF Recommendation Number 16’ that include requirements to obtain, hold, and transmit originator and beneficiary information and to not allow transfers where such information is lacking including where the value transfer involves Virtual Assets. Authorised Persons and Recognised Bodies should note that, pursuant to section 10.3, the Regulator does not differentiate between the responsibilities of the originator or the beneficiary when it comes to ensuring that all relevant information accompanies a wire transfer, and that no de minimis threshold is applied to the size of a relevant wire transfer.
