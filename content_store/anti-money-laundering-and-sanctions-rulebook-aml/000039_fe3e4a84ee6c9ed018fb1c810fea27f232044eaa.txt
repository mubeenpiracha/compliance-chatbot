10.2.2 An Authorised Person must:

(a)

not enter into a correspondent banking relationship with a Shell Bank; and

(b)

take appropriate measures to ensure that it does not enter into, or continue a corresponding banking relationship with, a bank which is known to permit its accounts to be used by Shell Banks.

Guidance

1.

The rules and guidance set out in Rule 9.2 above also apply to correspondent banking business partners. This Rule provides further details on specific requirements applicable to a correspondent banking business relationship.

2.

With regard to Correspondent Banking Clients and, if applicable, other qualified professionals, specific care should be taken to assess their AML/TFS arrangements regarding customer identification, Transaction monitoring, terrorist financing and other relevant elements, and to verify that these business partners comply with the same or equivalent AML/TFS requirements as the Relevant Person. Information on applicable laws and regulations regarding the prevention of money laundering should be obtained.

3.

A Relevant Person should ensure that a Correspondent Banking Client does not use the Relevant Person's products and services to engage in business with Shell Banks. A Shell Bank would be a bank that has no physical presence in the country in which it is incorporated and licensed, and which is unaffiliated with a regulated financial Group that is subject to effective consolidated supervision. The Regulator does not consider that the existence of a local agent or low-level staff constitutes physical presence.

4.

If applicable, information on distribution networks and delegation of duties should be obtained.
