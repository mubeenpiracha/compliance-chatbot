 to ensure that the risk rating assigned to a customer under Rule 7.1.1(1)(b) remains appropriate for the customer in light of the money laundering risks.

8.6.2 A Relevant Person must apply an intensified and ongoing monitoring programme with

respect to higher risk Transactions and customers.

Guidance

1.

The customer identification process does not end at the time of establishing a business relationship with a customer or, where relevant, undertaking a specific transaction or business activity on behalf of a customer. Following the start of the customer relationship, a Relevant Person should ensure that all relevant evidence and information is kept up to date including, for example, the list of authorised signatories who can act on behalf of a corporate customer.

2.

In complying with Rule 8.6.1(d), a Relevant Person should undertake a periodic review to ensure that non-static customer identity documentation is accurate and up to date. A Relevant Person is expected to ensure that the information and the evidence obtained from a customer is valid and has not expired, for example when obtaining copies of identification documentation such as a passport or identification card. Examples of non-static identity documentation include passport number and residential/business address and, for a Legal Person, its share register or list of partners.

3.

A Relevant Person should undertake a review under Rule 8.6.1(d) and (e) particularly when:

(a)

the Relevant Person changes its CDD documentation requirements;

(b)

an unusual Transaction with the customer is expected to take place;

(c)

there is a material change in the business relationship with the customer; or

(d)

there is a material change in the nature or ownership of the customer.

4.

The degree of the ongoing due diligence to be undertaken will depend on the customer risk assessment carried out under Rule 7.1.1.

5.

A Relevant Person's Transaction monitoring policies, procedures, systems and controls, which may be implemented by manual or automated systems, or a combination thereof, are one of the most important aspects of effective CDD. Whether a Relevant Person should undertake the monitoring by means of a manual or computerised system, or both, will depend on a number of factors, including:

(a)

the size and nature of the Relevant Person's business and customer base; and

(b)

the complexity and volume of customer Transactions.

8.6.3 A Relevant Person must review its customers, their businesses, and Transactions,

against Sanctions Lists when complying with Rule 8.6.1(d).

8.7

Failure to conduct or complete Customer Due Diligence

8.7.1

(1)

Where, in relation to a customer, a Relevant Person is unable to conduct or complete the requisite CDD in accordance with Rule 8.1.1 it must, where appropriate:

(a)

not carry out a Transaction with or for the customer through a bank account or in cash;

(b)

not open an account or otherwise provide a service;

(c)

not otherwise establish a business relationship or carry out a Transaction;

(d)

terminate or suspend any existing business relationship with the customer;

(e)

return any monies or assets received from the customer; and

(f)

consider whether the inability to conduct or complete CDD necessitates the making of a Suspicious Activity/Transaction Report under Rule 14.3.1(c).

(2)

A Relevant Person is not obliged to comply with (1)(a) to (e) if:

(a)

to do so would amount to "tipping off" the customer, in breach of Federal AML Legislation; or

(b)

the FIU directs the Relevant Person to act otherwise.

Guidance

1.

In complying with Rule 8.7.1(1) a Relevant Person should apply one or more of the measures in (a) to (f) as appropriate in the circumstances. Where CDD cannot be completed to a significant degree, it may be appropriate not to carry out a Transaction pending completion of CDD. Where CDD cannot be conducted, including where a material part of the CDD such as identifying and verifying Beneficial Owners cannot be undertaken, a Relevant Person should not establish a business relationship with the customer.

2.

A Relevant Person should note that Rule 8.7.1 applies to both existing and prospective customers. For prospective customers it may be
