Guidance

1.

In complying with Rule 8.7.1(1) a Relevant Person should apply one or more of the measures in (a) to (f) as appropriate in the circumstances. Where CDD cannot be completed to a significant degree, it may be appropriate not to carry out a Transaction pending completion of CDD. Where CDD cannot be conducted, including where a material part of the CDD such as identifying and verifying Beneficial Owners cannot be undertaken, a Relevant Person should not establish a business relationship with the customer.

2.

A Relevant Person should note that Rule 8.7.1 applies to both existing and prospective customers. For prospective customers it may be appropriate for a Relevant Person to terminate the business relationship before a product or service is provided. However, for existing customers, while termination of the business relationship should not be ruled out, suspension may be more appropriate depending on the circumstances, whilst further investigations are carried out. Whichever course of action is taken, the Relevant Person should be careful not to tip off the customer.
