APPLYING A RISK-BASED APPROACH TO AML/TFS

5.1

The risk-based approach

5.1.1 A Relevant Person must:

(a)

assess and address its money laundering risks under the AML Rulebook by reviewing the risks to which the Relevant Person is exposed as a result of the nature of its business, customers, products, services and any other matters which are relevant in the context of money laundering; and

(b)

ensure that any risk-based assessment undertaken for the purposes of complying with a requirement in the AML Rulebook is:

(i)

objective and proportionate to the risks;

(ii)

based on reasonable grounds;

(iii)

properly documented; and

(iv)

updated at appropriate intervals.

Guidance

1.

Rule 5.1.1 requires a Relevant Person to adopt an approach to AML/TFS which is proportionate to the risks. This is called the "risk-based approach" ("RBA"). The Regulator expects the RBA to be a key part of the Relevant Person's AML/TFS compliance culture and to cascade down from the Senior Management to the rest of the organisation. Embedding the RBA within its business allows a Relevant Person to make decisions and allocate AML/TFS resources in the most efficient and effective way.

2.

In implementing the RBA, a Relevant Person is expected to have in place processes to identify, assess, monitor, manage and mitigate money laundering risks. The general principle is that where there are higher risks of money laundering, a Relevant Person is required to take enhanced measures to manage and mitigate those risks. Correspondingly, when the risks are lower, simplified measures are permitted. Simplified measures are not permitted where there is a suspicion of money laundering.

3.

The RBA should not be seen as a "tick-box" approach to AML/TFS. Instead a Relevant Person is required to assess relevant money laundering risks and adopt a proportionate response to such risks, however, even where a customer is assessed through the RBA as being low-risk a minimum of simplified CDD must be undertaken in relation to that customer.

4.

In adopting an RBA, a Relevant Person should continue to meet the requirements that are mandated under the AML Rulebook including:
