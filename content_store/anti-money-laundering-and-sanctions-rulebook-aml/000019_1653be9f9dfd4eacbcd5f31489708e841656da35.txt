1.

The risk assessment of a customer requires a Relevant Person to allocate an appropriate risk rating to the customer. Risk ratings should be either descriptive, such as "low”, “medium” or "high", or a sliding, ordinal numeric scale such as 1 for the lowest risk to 10 for the highest, with at least three differentiated risk ratings. All the factors set out in both 7.1.2 and 7.1.3 should be considered in order to assess and allocate the appropriate risk rating to the customer.
