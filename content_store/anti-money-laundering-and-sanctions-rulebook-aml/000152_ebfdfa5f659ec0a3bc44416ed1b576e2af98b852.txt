Guidance

1.

In Rule 8.4.1, Enhanced CDD measures are mandatory to the extent that they are applicable to the relevant customer or the circumstances of the business relationship and to the extent that the risks would reasonably require it. Therefore, the extent of additional measures to be conducted is a matter for the Relevant Person to determine on a case-by-case basis.

2.

In Rule 8.4.1(e), Senior Management approval may be given by an individual member of the Relevant Person's Senior Management or by a committee of senior managers appointed to consider high-risk customers. Such approval may also be outsourced within the Group, but only to a suitably qualified individual or committee.

3.

For high-risk customers, a Relevant Person should, in order to mitigate the perceived potential and actual risks, exercise a greater degree of diligence throughout the course of the customer relationship and should endeavour to understand the nature of the customer's business and consider whether it is consistent and reasonable.
