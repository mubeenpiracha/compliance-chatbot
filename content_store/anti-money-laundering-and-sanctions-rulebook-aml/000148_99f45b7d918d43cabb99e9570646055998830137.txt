AML VER10.020125

4.

The risk of corruption-related money laundering increases where a Relevant Person deals with a PEP. Corruption may involve serious crimes and has become the subject of increasing global concern. Corruption offences are predicate crimes under Federal AML Legislation.

5.

The Regulator considers that after leaving office a PEP remains a higher risk for money laundering if such an individual continues to exert political influence or otherwise poses a risk of being involved in corruption.

6.

The fact that an individual is a PEP does not automatically mean that the individual must be assessed to be a high-risk customer: however, Enhanced CDD still needs to be undertaken on PEPs. A Relevant Person will need to assess the particular circumstances relating to each PEP to determine what risk category is appropriate.
