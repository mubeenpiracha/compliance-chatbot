Guidance on the customer risk assessment

1.

The risk assessment of a customer requires a Relevant Person to allocate an appropriate risk rating to the customer. Risk ratings should be either descriptive, such as "low”, “medium” or "high", or a sliding, ordinal numeric scale such as 1 for the lowest risk to 10 for the highest, with at least three differentiated risk ratings. All the factors set out in both 7.1.2 and 7.1.3 should be considered in order to assess and allocate the appropriate risk rating to the customer.

2.

Depending on the outcome of a Relevant Person's assessment of its customer's money laundering risk, a Relevant Person should decide to what degree CDD will need to be performed. For a customer exhibiting significant potential risk for money laundering the Relevant Person is required to carry out Enhanced CDD under Rule 8.4, in addition to the normal CDD required under Rule 8.3. For a customer rated low risk, the Relevant Person may be able to carry out Simplified CDD under Rule 8.5. For any other customer, the Relevant Person must undertake CDD under Rule 8.3.
