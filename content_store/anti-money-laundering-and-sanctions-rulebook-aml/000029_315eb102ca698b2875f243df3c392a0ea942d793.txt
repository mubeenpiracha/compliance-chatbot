The FATF has issued guidance on Targeted Financial Sanctions. Such guidance has been issued to assist in implementing the Targeted Financial Sanctions and activity-based financial prohibitions. This guidance can be found on the FATF website www.fatf-gafi.org.

29.

Sanctions and the import and export controls imposed or administered by other national and supranational bodies may apply or be relevant to a Relevant Person or its operations and the conduct of its business. In particular, Sanctions administered by the European Union, the U.K. (“HM Treasury”) and the U.S. (Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”)) may need to be carefully considered. The Regulator expects a Relevant Person to consider and take positive steps to ensure compliance where required or appropriate.
