Guidance

1.

'FATF Recommendation Number 16' seeks to ensure that national or international electronic payment and message systems, including fund or wire transfer systems such as SWIFT, are not misused as a means to break the money laundering audit trail. Therefore, the information about a customer as the originator of the wire transfer should remain with the payment instruction throughout the payment chain.

2.

Relevant Persons should monitor for, and conduct enhanced scrutiny of, suspicious activities, including incoming wire transfers that do not contain complete originator information, including name, address and account number or unique reference number.

3.

The Regulator considers that concealing or removing in a wire transfer any of the information required by Rule 10.3.2(3) would be a breach of the requirement to ensure that the wire transfer contains accurate originator and beneficiary information.

4.

The Regulator expects compliance by Authorised Persons and Recognised Bodies with ‘FATF Recommendation Number 15’, FATF’s Interpretative Note (R.15/INR.15) and ‘FATF Recommendation Number 16’ that include requirements to obtain, hold, and transmit originator and beneficiary information and to not allow transfers where such information is lacking including where the value transfer involves Virtual Assets. Authorised Persons and Recognised Bodies should note that, pursuant to section 10.3, the Regulator does not differentiate between the responsibilities of the originator or the beneficiary when it comes to ensuring that all relevant information accompanies a wire transfer, and that no de minimis threshold is applied to the size of a relevant wire transfer.

10.4 Audit
