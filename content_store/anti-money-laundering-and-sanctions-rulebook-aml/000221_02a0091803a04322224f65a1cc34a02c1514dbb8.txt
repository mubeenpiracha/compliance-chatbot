Guidance

1.

The individual appointed as the deputy MLRO need not apply for the Regulatorâ€™s approval.

2.

A Relevant Person should make adequate arrangements to ensure that it remains in compliance with the AML Rulebook in the event that its MLRO is absent. Adequate arrangements would include appointing a temporary MLRO for the period of the MLRO's absence or making sure that the Relevant Person's AML/TFS systems and controls allow it to continue to comply with these Rules when the MLRO is absent.

12.1.7 A Relevant Person may outsource the role of MLRO to an individual outside the Relevant Person provided that the individual under the outsourcing agreement is and remains suitable to perform the MLRO role.
