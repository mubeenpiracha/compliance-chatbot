Guidance

1.

"Know your business partner" is as important as "Know Your Customer". A Relevant Person is therefore required to verify the identity of a prospective business partner and to obtain evidence of it. The same documentation that is used to identify customers should be obtained from the business partner prior to conducting any business.

2.

A Relevant Person should verify whether any secrecy or data protection law exists in the country of incorporation of the business partner that would prevent access to relevant data.

3.

The requirement to identify the business partner is meant to cover only those business partners who may pose any relevant money laundering risks to the Relevant Person. Hence, a Relevant Person would not be required to establish and verify the identity of, for example, its maintenance or cleaning service.

4.

The Regulator may take into account the identity of a Relevant Person's business partner and the nature of their relationship in considering the fitness and propriety of a Relevant Person.
