Guidance

1.

Authorised Persons are reminded that under GEN Rule 5.5.1 the MLRO function is a mandatory appointment. For the avoidance of doubt, the individual appointed as the MLRO of an Authorised Person, other than a Representative Office, is the same individual who holds the Controlled Function of MLRO of that Authorised Person. Authorised Persons are also reminded that the guidance under GEN Rule 5.5.2 sets out the grounds under which the Regulator will determine whether to grant a waiver from the residence requirements for an MLRO. The same guidance is relevant to other Relevant Persons seeking a waiver from the MLRO residence requirements.

2.

The individual appointed as the MLRO of a Recognised Investment Exchange or Recognised Clearing House is the same individual who holds the position of MLRO of that Recognised Investment Exchange or Recognised Clearing House under the relevant MIR Rule.

12.1.4 If the MLRO leaves the employment of the Relevant Person, the Relevant Person must immediately appoint a new MLRO or arrange temporary cover for the MLRO appointment.
