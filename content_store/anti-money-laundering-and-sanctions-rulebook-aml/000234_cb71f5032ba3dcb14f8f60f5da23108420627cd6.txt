Guidance

1.

The Regulator considers it appropriate that all new relevant Employees of a Relevant Person be given appropriate AML/TFS training as soon as reasonably practicable after commencing employment with the Relevant Person, and thereafter on a periodic basis.

2.

A relevant Employee would include a member of the Senior Management or operational staff, any Employee with customer contact or who handles or may handle customer monies or assets, and any other Employee who might otherwise encounter money laundering in the business.

3.

Relevant Persons should take an RBA to AML/TFS training. The Regulator considers that AML/TFS training should be provided by a Relevant Person to each of its relevant Employees at intervals appropriate to the role and responsibilities of the Employee. In the case of an Authorised Person the Regulator expects that training should be provided to each relevant Employee at least annually.

4.

The manner in which AML/TFS training is provided by a Relevant Person need not be in a formal classroom setting, rather it may be via an online course or any other similarly appropriate manner.
