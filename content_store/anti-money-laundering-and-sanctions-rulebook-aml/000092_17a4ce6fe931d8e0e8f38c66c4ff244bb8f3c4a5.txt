The risk-based assessment of the customer and the proposed business relationship, Transaction or product required under this Chapter is required to be undertaken prior to the establishment of a business relationship with a customer. Because the risk rating assigned to a customer resulting from this assessment determines the level of CDD that must be undertaken for that customer, this process must be completed before the CDD is completed for the customer. The Regulator is aware that in practice there will often be some degree of overlap between the customer risk assessment and CDD. For example, a Relevant Person may undertake some aspects of CDD, such as identifying Beneficial Owners, when it performs a risk assessment of the customer. Conversely, a Relevant Person may also obtain relevant information as part of CDD which has an impact on its customer risk assessment. Where information obtained as part of CDD of a customer affects the risk rating of a customer, the change in risk rating should be reflected in the degree of CDD undertaken.
