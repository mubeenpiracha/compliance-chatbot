A Relevant Person must also apply CDD measures to each existing customer under Rules 8.3.1, 8.4.1 or 8.5.1 as applicable:

For the purposes of 8.1.2(1), in determining when it is appropriate to apply CDD measures in relation to existing customers, a Relevant Person must take into account, amongst other things:

(a)

any indication that the identity of the customer, or the customer’s Beneficial Owners, has changed;

(b)

any Transactions that are not reasonably consistent with the Relevant Person’s knowledge of the customer;

Guidance

1.

A Relevant Person should undertake appropriate CDD in a manner proportionate to the customer's money laundering risks. This means that all customers are subject to CDD under Rule 8.3.1. However, for high-risk customers, additional Enhanced Customer Due Diligence measures should also be undertaken under Rule 8.4.1. For customers having a low-risk rating, the requirements under Rule

AML VER10.020125

8.3.1 may be modified according to the assessed risk, in accordance with Rule 8.5.1.

2.

The frequency for undertaking CDD for existing customers will be determined by the risk rating assigned to a particular customer. The Regulator expects that customers rated high risk for money laundering should be reviewed more frequently than customers rated lower risk for money laundering.

3.

A Relevant Person should undertake CDD to guard against a range of money laundering risks as well as a range of financial crime risks, including fraud.

8.2

(b)

the Relevant Person does not have to fulfil the verification of the identity of a customer and Beneficial Owners obligations under the AML Rules before undertaking a Transaction for a customer or occasional transaction where it has, on reasonable grounds, established that:

(i)

there is little risk of money laundering and that risk is effectively managed; and

(ii)

doing so would interrupt or delay the normal course of business in respect of effecting the Transaction.

(2)

(a)

A Relevant Person that is a DNFBP must fulfil the appropriate CDD and reporting obligations where applicable before the Relevant Person prepares for or carries out a Transaction or provision of a service in Rule 8.1.1(2)(a), (d), (e) or (f).
