DFSA may publish a list

3A.4.1 (1)

The DFSA may, without the need for an application, publish a list (an Initial List) of Crypto Tokens that are taken to be Recognised by the DFSA.

(2)

The DFSA must publish any Initial List within 30 days of the commencement date (as defined in Rule 10.5.1(1)).

(3)

The DFSA may include a Crypto Token on the Initial List if it is satisfied that the Crypto Token would meet the criteria in Rule 3A.3.4 if an application was made for its recognition.

(4)

The DFSA may amend the Initial List if it is necessary due to a change in the name of a Crypto Token on the list or if there is a fork affecting a Crypto Token on the list and the DFSA is satisfied that one or more Crypto Tokens resulting from the fork should be included on the list.

(5)

The DFSA is not to add a Crypto Token to the Initial List, except as provided in (4) if there is a fork.

(6)

The DFSA may remove a Crypto Token from the Initial List if it is no longer satisfied that it meets the criteria in Rule 3A.3.4.
