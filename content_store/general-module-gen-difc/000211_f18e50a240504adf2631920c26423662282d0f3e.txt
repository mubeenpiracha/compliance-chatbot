GENERAL (GEN)

Guidance

1.

Rule 3A.2.4 prohibits Authorised Persons (i.e. Persons that are authorised under a Licence to provide Financial Services) from also carrying on unregulated business relating to certain Excluded Tokens i.e. Utility Tokens and NFTs. The only exception is that an Authorised Person that is permitted to Provide Custody may also carry on that activity in relation to Utility Tokens and NFTs.

2.

The prohibition is intended to avoid any misconception by users of a service that regulatory requirements for Financial Services apply to the unregulated part of the business. The prohibition does not extend to the use of digital currencies issued by governments, government agencies, central banks or other monetary authorities. Therefore, an Authorised Person may provide a service or carry on an activity involving such a digital currency.
