Scope of corporate governance

1.

Corporate governance is a framework of systems, policies, procedures and controls through which an entity:

a.

promotes the sound and prudent management of its business;

b.

protects the interests of its customers and stakeholders; and

c.

places clear responsibility for achieving (a) and (b) on the Governing Body and its members and the senior management of the Authorised Person.

2.

Many requirements designed to ensure sound corporate governance of companies, such as those relating to shareholder and minority protection and responsibilities of the Board of Directors of companies, are found in the company laws and apply to Authorised Persons. Additional disclosure requirements also apply if they are listed companies. The requirements in this Module are tailored to Authorised Persons and are designed to augment and not to exclude the application of those requirements.
