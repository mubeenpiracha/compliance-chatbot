Rule 3A.2.3 prohibits certain activities in the DIFC relating to Algorithmic Tokens i.e. Crypto Tokens that use an algorithm to increase or decrease the supply of the Crypto Token to stabilise their price or reduce volatility. This is because the functioning of these algorithms is often not transparent to users, markets or regulators and due to concerns about whether such algorithms function effectively.
