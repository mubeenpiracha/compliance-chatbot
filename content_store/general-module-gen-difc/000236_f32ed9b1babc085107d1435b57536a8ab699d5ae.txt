1.

Rule 3A.4.1 confers on the DFSA a one-off power to issue a list of Recognised Crypto Tokens on the commencement of the regime for the regulation of Crypto Tokens. The list cannot be added to after it is published, and any further Crypto Tokens will be recognised only if an application is made to the DFSA for recognition under section 3A (and the DFSA is satisfied under that section that the criteria for recognition are met).
