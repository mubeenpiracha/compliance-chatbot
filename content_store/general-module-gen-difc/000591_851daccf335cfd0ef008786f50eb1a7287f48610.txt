GENERAL (GEN)

3.

Generally, not only the senior management but also the Persons Undertaking Key Control Functions should be involved in the remuneration policy-setting and monitoring process to ensure the integrity and objectivity of the process.

Who should be covered by remuneration policy

4.

An Authorised Person’s remuneration policy should, at a minimum, cover those specified in Rule 5.3.31(1)(c). Accordingly, the members of the Governing Body, the senior management, the Persons Undertaking Key Control Functions and any major risk taking Employees should be included in the firm’s remuneration policy. With the exception of the ‘senior management’, all the other three categories attract their own definitions. Although the expression “senior management” carries its natural meaning, Rule 5.3.30(3) describes the senior management’s role as the “day- to-day management of the firm’s business…” Guidance No. 3 under Rule 5.3.3 gives further clarification as to who may perform senior management functions.
