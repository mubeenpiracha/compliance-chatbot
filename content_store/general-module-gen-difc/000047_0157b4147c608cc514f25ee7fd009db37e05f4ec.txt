The provision of a Credit Facility to finance the acquisition of goods or services will include the provision of ‘Buy Now Pay Later’ (BNPL) services. This includes, for example, arrangements where, when a consumer purchases goods or services from a merchant, the consumer becomes liable to make instalment payments to a third party (the BNPL provider) instead of paying the purchase price directly to the merchant. Under such arrangements the BNPL provider will typically make an upfront payment to the merchant of an amount equal to the purchase price less a discount.
