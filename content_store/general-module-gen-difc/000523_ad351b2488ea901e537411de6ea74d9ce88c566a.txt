implementation of the transfer scheme will result in the Authorised Firm or transferee breaching a requirement in a law or Rule, for example, if the transferee does not have the necessary authorisation to conduct that business or if the transfer will result in the Authorised Firm or transferee breaching a prudential requirement.

The type of case where the DFSA anticipates giving its consent to a transfer scheme is where the scheme is relatively simple and the applicant has taken all reasonable steps to pursue other options but has been unable to complete the necessary processes because, for example, a small number of Clients do not respond.
