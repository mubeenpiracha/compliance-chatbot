A passive display of literature which advertises Investments or Crypto Tokens does not amount to arranging, unless something more is done to help potential investors or policyholders to buy such Investments, Crypto Tokens or policies. For example, a passive display of leaflets advertising Investments in property funds at the reception of an office, such as an accountant’s office, or a display of leaflets advertising permanent health policies of an Long-Term Insurance insurer at a doctor’s or dentist’s waiting rooms, would not constitute arranging, provided the relevant service providers or employees in their offices do not assist or facilitate transactions by potential investors/policyholders.
