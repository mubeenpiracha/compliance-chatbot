Defined Terms

9.

Defined terms are identified throughout the Rulebook by the capitalisation of the initial letter of a word or of each word in a phrase and are defined in the Glossary (GLO), however, where a word or phrase is used only, for example, in a prudential context in PIB then for convenience purposes it is only defined under Rule 1.2.1 of PIB rather than in GLO. Similarly, in AML Rule 3.2.1 and in FPR section 1.3 there are a number of specific definitions. Unless the context otherwise requires, where capitalisation of the initial letter is not used, an expression has its natural meaning.
