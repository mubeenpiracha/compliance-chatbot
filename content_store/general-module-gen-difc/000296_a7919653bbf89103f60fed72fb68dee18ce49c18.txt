The information included in the annual report is made available to the DFSA and the shareholders, and in the case of a listed company, to the public. The Governing Body of the Authorised Person should also consider what additional information should be included in the annual report. In the case of banks, insurers and dealers, more detailed disclosure of remuneration structure and strategy and its impact on the financial soundness of the firm would be required. When providing disclosure relating to remuneration in its annual report, Authorised Persons should take account of the legal obligations that apply to the firm including the confidentiality of information obligations.
