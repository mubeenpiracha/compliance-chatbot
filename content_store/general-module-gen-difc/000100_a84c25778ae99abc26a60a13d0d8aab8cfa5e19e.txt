‘holding or controlling’ Client

11.

In the case of Investments the title to which is evidenced by a physical instrument (e.g. a share or debenture certificate), a Person who has physical possession of the certificate ‘holds’ it. It is possible that the Person who has physical possession is also the legal owner (i.e. the Person in whose name the title to the certificate is registered). If this is not the case, the Person who ‘holds’ the certificate is generally regarded as an agent of the legal owner whose name appears on the share or debenture certificate. An example would be a firm Providing Custody in whose name the certificates are registered, but the actual possession of the certificates is with a Third Party Agent (custodian) appointed by the firm. In this example, the firm Providing Custody continues to be subject to the Client Investments provisions in COB 6.13 and the Safe Custody Provisions in COB App6.
