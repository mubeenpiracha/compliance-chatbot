Guidance

The systems and controls referred to in Rule 5.5.2(4)(b) should enable an Authorised Person to protect its ICT Assets in accordance with the requirements in Rules 5.5.6 to 5.5.15 in a way that minimises the likelihood and impact of a successful Cyber Incident on its ICT Assets identified under Rule 5.5.5(1). They should be commensurate with the outcome of the assessment under Rule 5.5.5(2) and the Authorised Personâ€™s Cyber Risk tolerance determined under Rule 5.5.4(2)(c).

An Authorised Person may need to apply additional controls, depending on its nature, scale or complexity.
