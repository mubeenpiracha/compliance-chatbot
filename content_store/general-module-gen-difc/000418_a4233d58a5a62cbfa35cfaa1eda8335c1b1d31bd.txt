progress of the handling of the Complaint.

Guidance

1.

The DFSA considers 7 days to be an adequate period in which an Authorised Firm should be able to acknowledge most Complaints.

2.

The DFSA expects an update to be provided to the complainant in circumstances where the resolution of the Complaint is taking longer than 30 days.

Resolution of Complaints

9.2.5

Upon conclusion of an investigation of a Complaint, an Authorised Firm must promptly:

(a)

advise the complainant in writing of the resolution of the Complaint;

(b)

provide the complainant with clear terms of redress, if applicable; and

(c)

comply with the terms of redress if accepted by the complainant.

9.2.6

If the complainant is not satisfied with the terms of redress offered by the Authorised Firm, the Authorised Firm must inform the complainant of other avenues, if any, for resolution of the Complaint and provide him with the appropriate contact details upon request.
