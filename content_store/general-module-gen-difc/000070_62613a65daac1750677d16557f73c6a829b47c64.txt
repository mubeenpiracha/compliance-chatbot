b. a Person ‘dealing as agent’ acts as the agent of a party to the Investment or

Crypto Token transaction and has the authority to bind its principal.

5.

For example, a Person acting as an agent either:

a. executes the transaction for its principal (the Client); or

b.

if using another broker to execute the client order, commits the Client to the transaction by giving a binding order to the broker.

6.

In contrast, a Person acting as an arranger may, for example, receive and transmit client orders to a broker, but does not have the power to execute or enter into the transaction for the client, or commit the client to a transaction. See the exclusion in GEN Rule 2.8.3 from ‘Dealing in Investments as Agent’, and GEN Rule 2.9.1(2)(b), both of which reflect the above position.

Do arrangements that do not bring about transactions constitute arranging?
