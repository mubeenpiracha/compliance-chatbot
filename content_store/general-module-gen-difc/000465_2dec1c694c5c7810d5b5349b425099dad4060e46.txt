The DFSA will exercise its powers relating to Controllers in a manner proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of an Authorised Firmâ€™s business, and the impact a proposed change in control would have on that firm and its Clients. For example, the DFSA would generally be less likely to impose conditions requiring a proposed acquirer of control of an Authorised Firm whose financial failure would have a limited systemic impact or impact on its Clients to provide prudential support to the firm by contributing more capital. Most advisory and arranging firms will fall into this class.

(1) Where the DFSA proposes to approve a proposed acquisition or an increase in the level of control in an Authorised Firm pursuant to Rule 11.8.5(2)(a), it must:

(a)

do so as soon as practicable and in any event within 90 days of the receipt of a duly completed application, unless a different period is considered appropriate by the DFSA and notified to the applicant in writing; and

(b)

issue to the applicant, and where appropriate to the Authorised Firm, an approval notice as soon as practicable after making that decision.
