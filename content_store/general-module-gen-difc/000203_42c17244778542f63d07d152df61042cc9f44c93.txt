Whether a Crypto Token remains recognised after a fork in the blockchain will depend on the effect of the fork on the existing Crypto Token. If new Crypto Tokens are created they may no longer be covered by an existing recognition. For that reason, an applicant should identify any proposed fork and its effect, so that recognition can cover this contingency.
