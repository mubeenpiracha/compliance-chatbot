Guidance

A Token will be a Utility Token only if it can be used by the holder to pay for, receive a discount on, or access a product or service (whether current or proposed), and the product or service is provided by the issuer of the Token or of another entity in the issuerâ€™s group. However, if at any time during the lifecycle of a Token, it can be used for other purposes, for example, as a medium of exchange or for payment or investment purposes, its hybrid nature is likely to result in it falling outside the scope of the above definition. If this is the case, it is likely to be a Crypto Token, and a person should not carry out a Financial Service relating to that Token unless they are licensed to do so, and it is a Recognised Crypto Token.

Alternatively, if the Token has characteristics substantially similar to an Investment, it may be classified as an Investment Token. For further information about when a Token is an Investment Token, and the applicable requirements, see APP6.
