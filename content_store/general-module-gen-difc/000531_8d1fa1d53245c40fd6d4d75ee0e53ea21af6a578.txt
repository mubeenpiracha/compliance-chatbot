GENERAL (GEN)

Non-responsive applications

14.

Where, after submitting an application, a business does not:

(a)

intend to proceed with its application; or

(b)

work with the DFSA in a way that allows the DFSA to assess the application, for example, because the application remains incomplete or fails to meet the minimum standards,

the DFSA expects that business to withdraw its application.

Applying a simplified regulatory framework

15.

The DFSA will work with the applicant to understand its business proposal and to establish, on a case-by-case basis, whether any Rules should not apply to that business or apply to it with modifications during the testing phase.

16.

While the DFSA will consider giving relief from various parts of the Rulebook, it is not likely to waive or modify certain key requirements, for example, Rules relating to:

(c)

fitness and propriety (see Rule 7.2.5);

(d)

acting with integrity and with due skill, care and diligence (see Rules 4.2.1 and 4.2.2);

(e)

having due regard to customersâ€™ interests and communicating information in a way that is fair, clear and not misleading (see Rule 4.2.6);
