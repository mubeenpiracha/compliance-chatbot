Rule 2.9.7 excludes from being ‘arrangers’ lawyers and accountants, who, in the course of conducting their legal and accounting business, arrange for their clients to buy or sell Securities. To have the benefit of this exclusion, certain conditions have to be met (such as the activity being reasonably regarded as a necessary part of services provided by legal and accounting practitioners and not being separately remunerated). For example, if a lawyer arranges as part of estate planning services for a portfolio of investments to be sold by a brokerage firm, this exclusion can be applied, provided the lawyer’s fees do not include a separate charge for arranging the liquidation of the portfolio, and the lawyer does not assist or participate in the conclusion of the contracts.
