Guidance

An Authorised Firm needs to carry out proper due diligence to satisfy itself, on reasonable grounds, that the person to which it intends to refer its client is subject to substantially similar requirements to those that apply to an Authorised Firm carrying on Crypto Business in or from the DIFC. This due diligence needs to be undertaken before making the referral. The Authorised Firm should be able to demonstrate to the DFSA the basis upon which it has reasonably concluded that the requirements are substantially the same.
