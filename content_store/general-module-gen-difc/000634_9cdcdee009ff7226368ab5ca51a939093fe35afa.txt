Example

40.

B owns an issued Share in a company. B issues a Token to A which confers on A the right to buy that Share from B at a set price on a certain date, should A choose to do so. The Token confers rights and obligations that are substantially similar in nature to those conferred by a call Option and is therefore a Derivative Token that is considered to be an Option.

When is an Investment Token a Future?

41.

Futures are instruments comprising rights under a contract which meets the criteria in the definition in Rule A2.3.1(b). There are two types of Futures; those covered under Rule A2.3.1(b)(i), referred to in this Guidance as ‘commodity Futures’, and those covered under Rule A2.3.1(b)(ii), referred to in this Guidance as ‘financial Futures’. A financial Future is sometimes referred to as a contract for difference, or CFD.

42.

If a Token confers rights and obligations that are substantially similar in nature to those conferred by a contract meeting the definition of a Future, the Token is an Investment Token that is a Future and therefore a Derivative Token.
