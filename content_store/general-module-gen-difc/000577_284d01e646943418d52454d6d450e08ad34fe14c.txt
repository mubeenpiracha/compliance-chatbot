In addition to Fiat Crypto Tokens, other stablecoins exist where the value is determined by reference to other assets, such as gold or a commodity, or a basket of currencies. While they do not fall within the definition of a Fiat Crypto Token, they will be a Crypto Token unless they are an Investment, for example, a Derivative or a Unit of a Collective Investment Fund.
