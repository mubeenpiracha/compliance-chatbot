Guidance

1.

If the application for approval lodged with the DFSA does not contain all the required information, then the 90 day period runs from the date on which all the relevant information has been provided to the DFSA.

2.

If a Person who has obtained the prior DFSA approval for an acquisition or an increase in the control of an Authorised Firm is unable to effect the acquisition before the end of the period referred to in Rule 11.8.6(2), it will need to obtain fresh approval from the DFSA.
