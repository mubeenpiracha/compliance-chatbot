a Fund transfer scheme.

12.1.4 A transfer scheme, other than a scheme referred to in Rule 12.1.3, is not

required to be sanctioned by a Court order to be effective if:

(a)

all of the Clients of the Authorised Firm who will be affected by the transfer scheme have consented to it;

(b)

the transfer scheme is expressly permitted under agreements between the Authorised Firm or transferee and the Clients of the Authorised Firm who will be affected by the scheme and any procedures in the agreements for giving effect to the scheme have been complied with; or

(c)

the DFSA has consented in writing to the transfer scheme under Rule 12.1.5.

12.1.5

(1)

An Authorised Firm or transferee may apply in writing to the DFSA seeking its consent to a transfer scheme.

(2)

The DFSA may consent in writing to the transfer scheme if it is reasonably satisfied that:

(a)

the scheme is not a transfer scheme referred to in Rule 12.1.3;

(b)

it is more appropriate and proportionate, and in the overall interests of Clients affected by the scheme, for the Authorised Firm or transferee to seek the DFSAâ€™s consent rather than applying to the Court for an order sanctioning the scheme;
