Application to Branches and Groups

8.

As part of the flexible and proportionate application of corporate governance standards to firms, whether a firm is a Branch or a subsidiary within a Group is also taken into account. An Authorised Person which is a member of a Group may, instead of developing its own corporate governance policies, adopt group-wide corporate governance standards. However, the Governing Body of the Authorised Person should consider whether those standards are appropriate for the firm, and to the extent possible, make any changes as necessary.

In the case of a Branch, corporate governance practices adopted at the head office would generally apply to the Branch and are expected to be adequate. The DFSA considers, as part of its authorisation of a Branch and on-going supervision, the adequacy of regulatory and supervisory arrangements applicable in the home jurisdiction, including a corporate governance framework adopted and implemented by the head office (see section 3.2.15 of the RPP Sourcebook).
