the business that may be carried on under the Licence to testing the specific innovative product or service;

(b)

the number and type of customers that may take part in the testing; and

(c)

the period during which it may carry on testing.

The DFSA is also likely to impose conditions on the Licence, for example, requiring the business:

(a)

to comply with its Test Plan;

not to change or modify its business model or Test Plan without the DFSAâ€™s consent;
