Guidance

1.

Operating a Crowdfunding Platform under Rule 2.29.1 requires a Person not only to operate an electronic platform that brings together lenders and borrowers, investors and issuers or investors and sellers (collectively referred to as ‘users’), but also to administer a resulting loan agreement or Investment. The administration may be carried out by the platform operator itself or by another person acting under an arrangement with, or at the direction of, the platform operator.

2.

The activity in Rule 2.29.1(2)(a), (4)(a), and (5)(a) only covers electronic systems such as online portals and does not include, for example, meetings to facilitate a loan.

3.

A Crowdfunding Operator may in some cases also provide a facility that assists lenders or investors using the platform to transfer their rights and obligations under a loan agreement to another lender or to sell their Investment to another investor. If a Crowdfunding Operator provides such a facility, that activity will also fall within the definition of Operating a Crowdfunding Platform (see Rule 2.29.1(3) and (6)).
