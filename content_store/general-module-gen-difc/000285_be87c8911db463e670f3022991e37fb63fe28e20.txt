Whilst Rule 5.3.30 deals with two aspects of corporate governance, the requirements included in other provisions under sections 5.2 and 5.3 also go to the heart of sound corporate governance by promoting prudent and sound management of the Authorised Personâ€™s business in the interest of its customers and stakeholders. These requirements together are designed to promote sound corporate governance practices in Authorised Persons whilst also providing a greater degree of flexibility for Authorised Persons in establishing and implementing a corporate governance framework that are both appropriate and practicable to suit their operations.

Stakeholder groups of an Authorised Person, who would benefit from the sound and prudent management of firms, can be varied but generally encompass its owners (shareholders), customers (in the case of an AMI, its members and investors), creditors, counterparties and employees, whose interests may not necessarily be mutually coextensive. A key objective in enhancing corporate governance standards applicable to Authorised Persons is to ensure that firms are soundly and prudently managed, with the primary regard being had to its customers.
