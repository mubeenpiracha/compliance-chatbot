GENERAL (GEN)

Guidance

The requirements in respect of notification of changes relating to control of Branches (i.e. Non-DIFC established companies) are set out in Rule 11.8.10. Although some Credit Rating Agencies may be companies established in the DIFC, such companies will only be subject to the notification requirements relating to their Controllers. Accordingly, regardless of whether a Credit Rating Agency is a company established in the DIFC or a Branch operation, it is subject to the notification requirements only and not to the requirement for prior approval by the DFSA of changes relating to its Controllers.
