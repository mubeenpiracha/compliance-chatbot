Guidance

1.

Insurance Intermediation activities may be carried on by an Insurance Agent (i.e. a Person who acts as an agent of one or more insurers) or an Insurance Broker (i.e. a Person who acts as an agent of a policyholder), or by an Insurer itself, in relation to its own Contracts of Insurance. Generally, most activities of an Insurance Agent can be carried on by an Insurance Manager that has the authority to underwrite Contracts of Insurance in the DIFC.

2. For more information about Insurance Aggregation Sites, see Guidance items 2 to 4 under Rule 2.11.1.

3.

See the Guidance under Arranging Deals in Investments in section 2.9 for the distinction between the activities of ‘acting as agent’ and ‘arranging’.

4. A Person ‘acting as agent’ as set out in Rule 2.19.1(1)(b) for an Insurer effecting or carrying out contracts of Long-Term Insurance will need to hold an Insurance Intermediation or Insurance Management Licence.

5.

If an Insurance Intermediary wishes to carry on Insurance Intermediation activities in respect of a contract of Long-Term Insurance, that is not a contract of reinsurance, it must obtain an endorsement on its Licence (see Rule 2.2.10C).
