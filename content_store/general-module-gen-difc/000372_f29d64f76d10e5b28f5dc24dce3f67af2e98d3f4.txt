Guidance

Where an Authorised Firm applies for an endorsement to carry on a Financial Service with or for a Retail Client that involves dealing in a Restricted Speculative Investment, the DFSA would expect it to be able to demonstrate that:

(a)

either another Group member, or its head office if it is a Branch, is authorised and supervised by a Financial Services Regulator and has at least five years of relevant experience in dealing in Restricted Speculative Investments with Retail Clients; and

(b)

a sufficient number of the compliance staff, and client-facing staff involved in dealing in Restricted Speculative Investments, have at least three years of relevant experience.
