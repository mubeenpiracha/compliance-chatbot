Partnerships with existing Authorised Persons

29.

In some cases, a Person wishing to test innovative technology may seek to do so in partnership with an Authorised Person. If that is the case, and the activity is to be carried out under the Licence of the Authorised Person, paragraphs 26 to 28 will be relevant. Alternatively, if the business wishes to carry on the business in its own right, it will need to apply for a Licence.
