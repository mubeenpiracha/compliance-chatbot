to impose or vary conditions or restrictions on an Authorised Individual or Key Individual.

The DFSA shall give both the applicant, Authorised Individual or Key Individual (as the case may be) and the relevant Authorised Person or applicant to be an Authorised Person (as the case may be) an opportunity to make representations under the procedures in Schedule 3.
