The DFSA may by written notice require an Authorised Firm to:

search for, and communicate with, potential purchasers of the Authorised Firm’s business or part thereof;

CHAPTER 4 – RESOLUTION

84K. Conditions for Resolution

(1)

The DFSA may exercise its Resolution Powers or apply its Resolution Tools in relation to an Authorised Firm only where it is satisfied that the following conditions (the “Resolution Conditions”) are met:

(a)

the Authorised Firm is failing or is likely to fail;

(b)

having regard to timing and other relevant circumstances, it is not reasonably likely that any action will be taken by or in respect of the Authorised Firm that will prevent the failure or likely failure of the Authorised Firm within a reasonable timeframe; and

(c)

the taking of resolution action is in the public interest.

(2)

For the purposes of this Article, an Authorised Firm is failing or likely to fail where one or more of the following circumstances exist:

there are serious governance issues or deficiencies in its risk management and controls that may have a significant impact on the Authorised Firm’s financial condition; or

(e)

it is unable to pay its debts or other liabilities as they fall due,

but an Authorised Firm is not failing or likely to fail merely because one or more Early Intervention Powers have been exercised in relation to it.

In determining whether (1)(a) and (2) are met, the DFSA may take into account the likely impact on the Authorised Firm of the failure or likely failure of another entity in the Authorised Firm
