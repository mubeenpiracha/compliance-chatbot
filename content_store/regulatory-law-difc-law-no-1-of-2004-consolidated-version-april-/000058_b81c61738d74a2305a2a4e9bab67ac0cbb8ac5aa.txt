 under which such rights or liabilities may arise.

103

(3)

If an order makes provision for the transfer of property or liabilities:

(a)

the property is transferred to and vests in, and

(b)

the liabilities are transferred to and become liabilities of,

the transferee as a result of the order.

(4)

If any property or liability included in the order is governed by the law of any jurisdiction other than the DIFC, the order may require the firm concerned, if the transferee so requires, to take all necessary steps for securing that the transfer to the transferee of the property or liability is fully effective under the law of that country or territory.

(5)

Property transferred as the result of an order under this Article may, if the Court so directs, vest in the transferee free from any charge which is (as a result of the scheme) to cease to have effect.

(6)

An order under this Article which provides for the transfer of property is to be treated as an instrument of transfer for the purposes of any DIFC Law requiring the delivery of an instrument of transfer to register property.

111. Requirements of a scheme

(1)

Subject to Article 111(4), an application under Article 108 in respect of a scheme shall be accompanied by a report on the terms of the transfer scheme ("a scheme report").

(2)

A scheme report may be made only by a person:

(a)

appearing to the DFSA to have the skills necessary to enable him to make a proper report; and

(b)

nominated or approved for the purpose by the DFSA.

(3)

A scheme report must be made in a form approved by the DFSA.

(4)

The DFSA may, by written notice to the firm concerned, direct that a scheme report need not be provided, if it appears to the DFSA that, by reason of urgency, it is in the interests of the DIFC so to do.

(5)

The firm concerned must give written notice of the proposed transfer to all interested parties, such parties to be determined by the DFSA, to their last known mailing address.

(6)

The firm concerned must advise of the proposed transfer by way of a notice published in an appointed newspaper. An appointed newspaper is a publication best suited to bring the proposed transfer of business to the attention of any persons who may be affected by the transfer.

104

(7)

The DFSA may, by written notice to the firm concerned, direct that notice as prescribed in Articles 111(5) and (6) need not be provided, if it appears to the DFSA that, by reason of urgency, it is in the interests of the DIFC so to do.

(8)

The Court may not determine an application under Article 108 if the applicant or the firm concerned have failed to comply with the requirements in Article 111.

112. Conditions for sanctioning a transfer scheme

Before the Court may make an order for a transfer scheme, it must be satisfied that, before the transfer scheme takes effect, the transferee:

(a)

will have the authorisation required (if any) to enable the business which is to be transferred to be carried on in the place to which it is to be transferred; and

(b)

will possess adequate financial resources to carry on the business concerned in accordance with the legislation applicable in the place to which it is to be transferred.

113. Modifications

The DFSA Board of Directors may make Rules providing for prescribed provisions of this Part to have effect in relation to prescribed cases with such modifications as may be prescribed.
