The members of a company may remove an auditor from office at any time.

This power is exercisable only–

(a)

by ordinary resolution at a meeting and in accordance with section 480 (special notice required for resolution removing auditor from office), or

(b)

in the case of a company with only one member, by written resolution or a decision taken as mentioned in section 362 (records of decisions by sole member).

(3)

Nothing in this section is to be taken as depriving the person removed of compensation or damages payable to him in respect of the termination–

(a)

of his appointment as auditor, or

(b)

of any appointment terminating with that as auditor.

(4)

An auditor may not be removed from office before the expiration of his term of office except by resolution under this section.

480. Special notice required for resolution removing auditor from office

Special notice is required for a resolution at a general meeting of a company removing an auditor from office.

in any notice of the resolution given to members of the company, state the fact of the representations having been made, and

(b)

send a copy of the representations to every member of the company to whom notice of the meeting is or has been sent.

(6)

Copies of the representations need not be sent out and the representations need not be read at the meeting if, on the application either of the company or of any other person claiming to be aggrieved, the Court is satisfied that the auditor is using the provisions of this section to secure needless publicity for defamatory matter.
