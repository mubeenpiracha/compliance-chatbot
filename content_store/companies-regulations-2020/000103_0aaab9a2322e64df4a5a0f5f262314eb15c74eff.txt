 applies for permission under section 283 (application for permission to continue derivative claim) or 284 (application for permission to continue claim as a derivative claim).

(2)

Permission must be refused if the Court is satisfied–

(a)

that a person acting in accordance with section 162 (duty to promote the success of the company) would not seek to continue the claim, or

(b)

where the cause of action arises from an act or omission that is yet to occur, that the act or omission has been authorised by the company, or

(c)

where the cause of action arises from an act or omission that has already occurred, that the act or omission–

(i)

was authorised by the company before it occurred, or

(ii)

has been ratified by the company since it occurred.

(3)

In considering whether to give permission the Court must take into account, in particular–

(a)

whether the eligible member is acting in good faith in seeking to continue the claim,

(b)

the importance that a person acting in accordance with section 162 (duty to promote the success of the company) would attach to continuing it,

(c)

where the cause of action results from an act or omission that is yet to occur, whether the act or omission could be, and in the circumstances would be likely to be–

(i)

authorised by the company before it occurs, or

(ii)

ratified by the company after it occurs,

(d)

where the cause of action arises from an act or omission that has already occurred, whether the act or omission could be, and in the circumstances would be likely to be, ratified by the company,

(e)

whether the company has decided not to pursue the claim,

(f)

whether the act or omission in respect of which the claim is brought gives rise to a cause of action that the member could pursue in his own right rather than on behalf of the company.

(4)

In considering whether to give permission the Court shall have particular regard to any evidence before it as to the views of members of the company who have no personal interest, direct or indirect, in the matter.

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

(c)

has continued a derivative claim under this section.

Another eligible member of the company (“the applicant”) may apply to the Court for permission to continue the claim on the ground that–

(a)

the manner in which the proceedings have been commenced or continued by the claimant amounts to an abuse of the process of the Court,

(b)

the claimant has failed to prosecute the claim diligently, and

(c)

it is appropriate for the applicant to continue the claim as a derivative claim.

If it appears to the Court that the application and the evidence filed by the applicant in support of it do not disclose a prima facie case for giving permission, the Court –

(a)

must dismiss the application, and

(b) may make any consequential order it considers appropriate.

If the application is not dismissed under subsection (3), the Court–

(a)

may give directions as to the evidence to be provided by the company, and

On hearing the application, the Court may–
