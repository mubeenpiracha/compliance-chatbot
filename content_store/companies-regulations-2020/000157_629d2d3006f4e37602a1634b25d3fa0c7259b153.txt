CHAPTER 2

APPOINTMENT OF AUDITORS

Private companies

457. Appointment of auditors of private company: general

(1)

An auditor or auditors of a private company must be appointed for each financial year of the company, unless the directors reasonably resolve otherwise on the ground that audited accounts are unlikely to be required.

(2)

For each financial year for which an auditor or auditors is or are to be appointed (other than the company’s first financial year), the appointment must be made before the end of the period of one month beginning with–

(a)

the end of the time allowed for sending out copies of the company’s annual accounts and reports for the previous financial year (see section 406 (time allowed for sending out copies of accounts and reports)), or

276

(b)

if earlier, the day on which copies of the company’s annual accounts and reports for the previous financial year are sent out under section 405 (duty to circulate copies of annual accounts and reports).

This is the “period for appointing auditors”.

(3)

The directors may appoint an auditor or auditors of the company–

(a)

at any time before the company’s first period for appointing auditors,

(b)

following a period during which the company (being exempt from audit) did not have any auditor, at any time before the company’s next period for appointing auditors, or

(c)

to fill a casual vacancy in the office of auditor.

(4)

The members may appoint an auditor or auditors by ordinary resolution–

(a)

during a period for appointing auditors,

(b)

if the company should have appointed an auditor or auditors during a period for appointing auditors but failed to do so, or

(c)

where the directors had power to appoint under subsection (3) but have failed to make an appointment.

(5)

An auditor or auditors of a private company may only be appointed–

(a)

in accordance with this section, or

(b)

in accordance with section 458 (default power of Registrar).

This is without prejudice to any deemed re-appointment under section 459 (term of office of auditors of private company).

458. Appointment of auditors of private company: default power of Registrar

(1)

If a private company fails to appoint an auditor or auditors in accordance with section 457 (appointment of auditors of private company: general), the Registrar may appoint one or more persons to fill the vacancy.

(2) Where subsection (2) of that section applies and the company fails to make the necessary appointment before the end of the period for appointing auditors, the company must within one week of the end of that period give notice to the Registrar of its power having become exercisable.

(3)

If a company fails to give the notice required by this section, a contravention of these Regulations is committed by–

(a)

the company, and

(b)

every officer of the company who is in default.

(4)

A person who commits the contravention referred to in subsection (3) shall be liable to a level 3 fine.

459. Term of office of auditors of private company

An auditor or auditors of a private company hold office in accordance with the terms of their appointment, subject to the requirements that–

(a)

they do not take office until any previous auditor or auditors cease to hold office, and

(b)

they cease to hold office at the end of the next period for appointing auditors unless re-appointed.

(2) Where no auditor has been appointed by the end of the next period for appointing auditors, any auditor in office immediately before that time is deemed to be re-appointed at that time, unless–

(a)

he was appointed by the directors, or

(b)

the company’s articles require actual re-appointment, or

(c)

the deemed re-appointment is prevented by the members under section 460 (prevention by members of deemed re-appointment of auditor), or
