for a private company, nine months after the end of the relevant accounting reference period, and

(b)

for a public company, six months after the end of that period.

This is subject to the following provisions of this section.

If the relevant accounting reference period is the company’s first and is a period of more than twelve months, the period is–

(a)

nine months or six months, as the case may be, from the first anniversary of the incorporation of the company, or

(b)

three months after the end of the accounting reference period,

whichever last expires.

(a)

that applicable in accordance with the above provisions, or

(b)

three months from the date of the notice under that section,

whichever last expires.

(5)

If for any special reason the Registrar thinks fit he may, on an application made before the expiry of the period otherwise allowed, by notice in writing to a company extend that period by such further period as may be specified in the notice.

(6)

Any such extension must not have the effect of extending the period for filing to more than twelve months after the end of the relevant accounting reference period.

If–

(a)

the specified date, or the last day of the specified previous period, is not the last day of a month but is the 29th or 30th, and
