 in respect of liability arising in relation to the shares under any provision of this Chapter or Chapter 6,

(b)

whether any person other than the applicant has paid or is likely to pay, whether in pursuance of any order of the Court or otherwise, any such amount.

(5)

In determining whether it should exempt the applicant in whole or in part from any liability, the Court must have regard to the following overriding principles-

(a)

a company that has allotted shares should receive money or money’s worth at least equal in value to their aggregate issue price or, if the case so requires, so much of that aggregate as is treated as paid up,

(b)

subject to that, where a company would, if the Court did not grant the exemption, have more than one remedy against a particular person, it should be for the company to decide which remedy it should remain entitled to pursue.

(6)

If a person brings proceedings against another (“the contributor”) for a contribution in respect of liability to a company arising under any provision of this Chapter or Chapter 6 and it appears to the Court that the contributor is liable to make such a contribution, the Court may, if and to the extent that it appears to it just and equitable to do so having regard to the respective culpability (in respect of the liability to the company) of the contributor and the person bringing the proceedings-

(a)

exempt the contributor in whole or in part from his liability to make such a contribution, or

(b)

order the contributor to make a larger contribution than, but for this subsection, he would be liable to make.

547. Penalty for contravention of this Chapter

(1)

If a company contravenes any of the provisions of this Chapter, a contravention of these Regulations is committed by-

(a)

the company, and

(b)

every officer of the company who is in default.

(2)

A person who commits a contravention of this Chapter is liable to a level 2 fine.

548. Enforceability of undertakings to do work etc

(1)

An undertaking given by any person, in or in connection with payment for shares in a company, to do work or perform services or to do any other thing, if it is enforceable by the company apart from this Chapter, is so enforceable notwithstanding that there has been a contravention in relation to it of a provision of this Chapter or Chapter 6.

(2)

This is without prejudice to section 546 (power of Court to grant relief etc in respect of liabilities).

549. The appropriate rate of interest

For the purposes of this Chapter the “appropriate rate” of interest is 5% per annum or such other rate as may be specified by order made by the Board.

Chapter 5

PUBLIC COMPANIES: INDEPENDENT VALUATION OF NON-CASH CONSIDERATION

Non-cash consideration for shares

550. Public company: valuation of non-cash consideration for shares

(1)

A public company must not allot shares as fully or partly paid up otherwise than in cash unless-

(a)

the consideration for the allotment has been independently valued in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter,

(b)

the valuer’s report has been made to the company during the six months immediately preceding the allotment of the shares, and

(c)

a copy of the report has been sent to the proposed allottee.

(2)

For this purpose the application of an amount standing to the credit of-

(a)

any of a company’s reserve accounts, or

(b)

its profit and loss account,

in paying up (to any extent) shares allotted to members of the company does not count as consideration for the allotment.

Accordingly, subsection 550(1) does not apply in that case.

(3)

If a company allots shares in contravention of subsection (1) and either-

(a)

the allottee has not received the valuer’s report required to be sent to him, or

(b)

there has been some other contravention of the requirements of this section or section 553 that the allottee knew or ought to have known amounted to a contravention,

319

the allottee is liable to pay the company an amount equal to the aggregate issue price of the shares (or, if the case so requires, so much of that aggregate as is treated as paid up by the consideration), with
