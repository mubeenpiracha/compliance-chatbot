is eligible for appointment as an auditor, and

(b)

is not prohibited by section 1034(1) (independence requirement) from acting as auditor of the company.

The company will commit a contravention of these Regulations if–

(a)

it fails to comply with a direction under subsection (2) within the period of 21 days beginning with the date on which it is given, or

(b)

it has previously committed a contravention under this subsection and the failure to comply with the direction which led to the contravention continues after the contravention.

if the report states that a second audit is needed, take such steps as are necessary for the carrying out of that audit.
