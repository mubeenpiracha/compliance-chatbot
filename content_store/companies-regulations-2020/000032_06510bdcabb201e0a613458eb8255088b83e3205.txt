The Registrar must, within 90 days of determining an application under section 58 (objection to company’s registered name), make his decision and his reasons for it available to the public.

(2)

He may do so by means of a website or by such other means as appear to him to be appropriate.

61. Order requiring name to be changed

(1)

If an application under section 58 (objection to company’s registered name) is upheld, the Registrar shall serve notice–

(a)

requiring the respondent company to change its name to one that is not an offending name, and

(b)

requiring all the respondents–

(i)

to take all such steps as are within their power to make, or facilitate the making, of that change, and

(ii)

not to cause or permit any steps to be taken calculated to result in another company being registered with a name that is an offending name.

(2)

An “offending name” means a name that, by reason of its similarity to the name associated with the applicant in which he claims goodwill, would be likely–

(a)

to be the subject of a direction under section 56 (power to direct change of name in case of similarity to existing name), or

(b)

to give rise to a further application under section 58 (objection to company’s registered name).

(1)

The notice must specify a date by which the respondent company’s name is to be changed and may be enforced in the same way as an order of the Court.

If the respondent company’s name is not changed in accordance with the order by the specified date, the Registrar may determine a new name for the company.

If the Registrar determines a new name for the respondent company he must give notice of his determination–

(a)

to the applicant, and

(b)

to the respondents.

For the purposes of this section a company’s name is changed when the change takes effect in accordance with section 69(1) (change of name: effect).

Appeal from Registrar’s decision

An appeal lies to the Court from any decision of the Registrar to uphold or dismiss an application under section 58 (objection to company’s registered name).

Notice of appeal against a decision upholding an application must be given before the date specified in the Registrar’s notice by which the respondent company’s name is to be changed.

If notice of appeal is given against a decision upholding an application, the effect of the Registrar’s notice is suspended.

If on appeal the Court–

(a)

affirms the decision of the Registrar to uphold the application, or

(b)

reverses the decision of the Registrar to dismiss the application,

the Court may (as the case may require) specify the date by which the Registrar’s notice is to be complied with, remit the matter to the Registrar or make any order or determination that the Registrar might have made.

If the Court determines a new name for the company it must give notice of the determination–

(a)

to the parties to the appeal, and

(b)

to the Registrar.
