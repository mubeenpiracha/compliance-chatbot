165. Duty to avoid conflicts of interest

(1)

A director of a company must not act on behalf of a company, or exercise any of his powers as a director, in relation to any matter in which he has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the company.

(2)

This applies in particular to the exploitation of any property, information or opportunity (and it is immaterial whether the company could take advantage of the property, information or opportunity).

(3)

This duty does not apply to a conflict of interest arising in relation to a transaction or arrangement with the company.

(4)

This duty is not infringed–

(a)

if the situation cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest, or

(b)

if the matter has been authorised by the directors who do not have a direct or indirect interest that conflicts with the interests of the company in such matter (“non-conflicted directors”), or

(c)

if the matter is authorised by the members.

(5)

Authorisation may be given by the non-conflicted directors–

(a)

where the company is a private company and nothing in the company’s constitution invalidates such authorisation, by the matter being proposed to and authorised by the non-conflicted directors, or

(b)

where the company is a public company and its constitution includes provision enabling the non-conflicted directors to authorise the matter, by the matter being proposed to and authorised by them in accordance with the constitution.

(6)

The authorisation is effective only if–

(a)

any requirement as to the quorum at the meeting at which the matter is considered is met without counting the director in question or any other director with a direct or indirect interest that conflicts with the interests of the company in such matter, and

(b)

the matter was agreed to without their voting or would have been agreed to if their votes had not been counted.

(7)

Any reference in this section to a conflict of interest includes a conflict of interest and duty and a conflict of duties.

166. Duty not to accept benefits from third parties

(1)

A director of a company must not accept a benefit from a third party conferred by reason of–

(a)

his being a director, or

(b)

his doing (or not doing) anything as director.

123

(2)

A “third party” means a person other than the company, an associated body corporate or a person acting on behalf of the company or an associated body corporate.

(3)

Benefits received by a director from a person by whom his services (as a director or otherwise) are provided to the company are not regarded as conferred by a third party.

(4)

This duty is not infringed if the acceptance of the benefit cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest.

(5)

Any reference in this section to a conflict of interest includes a conflict of interest and duty and a conflict of duties.

167. Duty to declare interest in proposed transaction or arrangement

(1)

If a director of a company is in any way, directly or indirectly, interested in a proposed transaction or arrangement with the company, he must declare the nature and extent of that interest to the other directors.

(2)

The declaration may (but need not) be made–

(a)

at a meeting of the directors, or

(b)

by notice to the directors in accordance with–

(i)

section 173 (declaration made by notice in writing), or

(ii)

section 174 (general notice treated as sufficient declaration).

(3)

If a declaration of interest under this section proves to be, or becomes, inaccurate or incomplete, a further declaration must be made.

(4)

Any declaration required by this section must be made before the company enters into the transaction or arrangement.

(5)

This section does not require a declaration of an interest of which the director is not aware or where the director is not aware of the transaction or arrangement in question.

For this purpose a director is treated as being aware of matters of which he ought reasonably to be aware.

(6)

A director need not declare an interest–

(a)

if it cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest,

(b)

if, or to the extent that, the other directors are already aware of it (and for this purpose the other directors are treated as aware of anything of which they ought reasonably
