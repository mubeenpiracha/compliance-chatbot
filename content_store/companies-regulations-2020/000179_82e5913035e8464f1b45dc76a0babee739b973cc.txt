 section.

533. References to holder of shares in relation to offer

(1)

In this Chapter, in relation to an offer to allot securities required by-

(a)

section 520 (existing shareholders’ right of pre-emption), or

(b)

any provision to which section 527 applies (articles conferring corresponding right),

a reference (however expressed) to the holder of shares of any description is to whoever was the holder of shares of that description at the close of business on a date to be specified in the offer.

(2)

The specified date must fall within the period of one month immediately before the date of the offer.

534. Saving for other restrictions on offer or allotment

(1)

The provisions of this Chapter are without prejudice to any other law or regulation applicable to the Abu Dhabi Global Market by virtue of which a company is prohibited (whether generally or in specified circumstances) from offering or allotting equity securities to any person.

(2) Where a company cannot by virtue of such a law or regulation applicable to the Abu Dhabi Global Market offer or allot equity securities to a holder of ordinary shares of the company, those shares are disregarded for the purposes of section 520 (existing shareholders’ right of pre-emption), so that-

(a)

the person is not treated as a person who holds ordinary shares, and

(b)

the shares are not treated as forming part of the ordinary share capital of the company.

535. Provisions about pre-emption not applicable to shares taken on formation

The provisions of this Chapter have no application in relation to the taking of shares by the initial shareholders on the formation of the company.

536. Public companies: allotment where issue not fully subscribed

(1)

No allotment shall be made of shares of a public company offered for subscription unless-

(a)

the issue is subscribed for in full, or

(b)

the offer is made on terms that the shares subscribed for may be allotted-

312

(i)

in any event, or

(ii)

if specified conditions are met (and those conditions are met).

(2)

If shares are prohibited from being allotted by subsection (1) and 40 days have elapsed after the first making of the offer, all money received from applicants for shares must be repaid to them forthwith, without interest.

(3)

If any of the money is not repaid within 48 days after the first making of the offer, the directors of the company are jointly and severally liable to repay it.

A director is not so liable if he proves that the default in the repayment of the money was not due to any misconduct or negligence on his part.

(4)

This section applies in the case of shares offered as wholly or partly payable otherwise than in cash as it applies in the case of shares offered for subscription.

(5)

In that case-

(a)

the references in subsection (1) to subscription shall be construed accordingly,

(b)

references in subsections (2) and (3) to the repayment of money received from applicants for shares include-

(i)

the return of any other consideration so received (including, if the case so requires, the release of the applicant from any undertaking), or

(ii)

if it is not reasonably practicable to return the consideration, the payment of money equal to its value at the time it was so received,

(c)

references to interest apply accordingly.

(6)

Any condition requiring or binding an applicant for shares to waive compliance with any requirement of this section is void.

537. Public companies: effect of irregular allotment where issue not fully subscribed

(1)

An allotment made by a public company to an applicant in contravention of section 536 (public companies: allotment where issue not fully subscribed) is voidable at the instance of the applicant within one month after the date of the allotment, and not later.

(2)

It is so voidable even if the company is in the course of being wound up.

(3)

A director of a public company who knowingly contravenes, or permits or authorises the contravention of, any provision of section 536 with respect to allotment is liable to compensate the company and the allottee respectively for any loss, damages, costs or expenses that the company or allottee may have sustained or incurred by the contravention.

(4)

Proceedings to recover any such loss, damages, costs or expenses may not be brought more than two years
