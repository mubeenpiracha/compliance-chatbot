Introduction

The provisions of this Schedule explain expressions used in section 1015 (meaning of “subsidiary” etc) and otherwise supplement that section.

Voting rights in a company

In section 1015(1)(b) the reference to the right to appoint or remove a majority of the board of directors is to the right to appoint or remove directors holding a majority of the voting rights at meetings of the board on all, or substantially all, matters.

A company shall be treated as having the right to appoint to a directorship if-

a person's appointment to it follows necessarily from his appointment as director of the company, or

(b)

the directorship is held by the company itself.

A right to appoint or remove which is exercisable only with the consent or concurrence of another person shall be left out of account unless no other person has a right to appoint or, as the case may be, remove in relation to that directorship.

Rights exercisable only in certain circumstances or temporarily incapable of exercise

Rights which are exercisable only in certain circumstances shall be taken into account only-

(a)

when the circumstances have arisen, and for so long as they continue to obtain, or

(b)

where the shares are held in connection with the granting of loans as part of normal business activities and apart from the right to exercise them for the purpose of preserving the value of the security, or of realising it, the rights are exercisable only in his interests.

Rights attributed to holding company

Rights shall be treated as held by a holding company if they are held by any of its subsidiary companies.
