Chapter 7

CLASSES OF SHARE AND CLASS RIGHTS

Introductory

570. Classes of shares

(1)

For the purposes of these Regulations shares are of one class if the rights attached to them are in all respects uniform.

(2)

For this purpose the rights attached to shares are not regarded as different from those attached to other shares by reason only that they do not carry the same rights to dividends in the 12 months immediately following their allotment.

Variation of class rights

571. Variation of class rights: companies having a share capital

(1)

This section is concerned with the variation of the rights attached to a class of shares in a company having a share capital.

(2)

Rights attached to a class of a company’s shares may only be varied-

(a)

in accordance with provision in the company’s articles for the variation of those rights, or

(b)

where the company’s articles contain no such provision, if the holders of shares of that class consent to the variation in accordance with this section.

(3)

This is without prejudice to any other restrictions on the variation of the rights.

(4)

The consent required for the purposes of this section on the part of the holders of a class of a company’s shares is-

(a)

consent in writing from the holders of at least three-quarters of the issued shares of that class (excluding any shares held as treasury shares), or

(b)

a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of that class sanctioning the variation.

(5)

Any amendment of a provision contained in a company’s articles for the variation of the rights attached to a class of shares, or the insertion of any such provision into the articles, is itself to be treated as a variation of those rights.

332

(6)

In this section, and (except where the context otherwise requires) in any provision in a company’s articles for the variation of the rights attached to a class of shares, references to the variation of those rights include references to their abrogation.

572. Variation of class rights: companies without a share capital

(1)

This section is concerned with the variation of the rights of a class of members of a company where the company does not have a share capital.

(2)

Rights of a class of members may only be varied-

(a)

in accordance with provision in the company’s articles for the variation of those rights, or

(b)

where the company’s articles contain no such provision, if the members of that class consent to the variation in accordance with this section.

(3)

This is without prejudice to any other restrictions on the variation of the rights.

(4)

The consent required for the purposes of this section on the part of the members of a class is-

(a)

consent in writing from at least three-quarters of the members of the class, or

(b)

a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the members of that class sanctioning the variation.

(5)

Any amendment of a provision contained in a company’s articles for the variation of the rights of a class of members, or the insertion of any such provision into the articles, is itself to be treated as a variation of those rights.

(6)

In this section, and (except where the context otherwise requires) in any provision in a company’s articles for the variation of the rights of a class of members, references to the variation of those rights include references to their abrogation.

573. Variation of class rights: saving for Court’s powers under other provisions

Nothing in section 571 or 572 (variation of class rights) affects the power of the Court under-

(a)

section 82 (application to cancel resolution for public company to be re- registered as private),

(b)

Part 25 (arrangements and reconstructions), or

(c)

Part 28 (protection of members against unfair prejudice).

574. Right to object to variation: companies having a share capital

(1)

This section applies where the rights attached to any class of shares in a company are varied under section 571 (variation of class rights: companies having a share capital).

(2)

The holders of not less in the aggregate than 15% of the issued shares of the class in question (being persons who did not consent to or vote in favour of the resolution for the variation) may apply to the Court to have the variation cancelled.
