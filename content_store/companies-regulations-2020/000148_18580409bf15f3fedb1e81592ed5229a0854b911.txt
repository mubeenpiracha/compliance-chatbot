If at the end of the specified period, or such longer period as the Registrar may allow, it appears to the Registrar that the directors have not–

(a)

given a satisfactory explanation of the accounts or report, or

(b)

revised the accounts or report so as to comply with the requirements of these Regulations,

the Registrar may apply to the Court.

(5)

The provisions of this section apply equally to revised annual accounts and revised directors’ reports, in which case they have effect as if the references to revised accounts or reports were references to further revised accounts or reports.

(b)

by a person authorised by the Registrar for the purposes of this section,

for a declaration that the annual accounts of a company do not comply, or a directors’ report does not comply, with the requirements of these Regulations and for an order requiring the directors of the company to prepare revised accounts or a revised report.

(2)

Notice of the application, together with a general statement of the matters at issue in the proceedings, shall be given by the applicant to the Registrar for registration.

the revision of any directors’ report, and

(c)

the taking of steps by the directors to bring the making of the order to the notice of persons likely to rely on the previous accounts,

and such other matters as the Court thinks fit.

(4)

If the Court orders the preparation of a revised directors’ report it may give directions as to–

(a)

the review of the report by the auditors,

(b)

the taking of steps by the directors to bring the making of the order to the notice of persons likely to rely on the previous report, and

(c)

such other matters as the Court thinks fit.

For this purpose every director of the company at the time of the approval of the accounts or report shall be taken to have been a party to the approval unless he shows that he took all reasonable steps to prevent that approval.
