Guidance

The exceptions in Rule 6.4.5(b) allow an Authorised Person to continue to provide key services to the market and to its Clients even if the Authorised Person would be considered to have knowledge of the timing and content of the Investment Research which is intended for publication to Clients, for example when it is impractical for an Authorised Person to put in place an information barrier because the Authorised Person has few Employees or cannot otherwise separate its functions.
