3.2

Communication of Information and Marketing Material

General

3.2.1 When communicating information to a Person in relation to a Specified Investment or Regulated Activity, an Authorised Person must take reasonable steps to ensure that the communication is clear, fair and not misleading.

Guidance

A communication addressed to a Professional Client may not need to include the same information, or be presented in the same way, as a communication addressed to a Retail Client.

3.2.2 An Authorised Person must not, in any form of communication with a Person, attempt to limit or avoid any duty or liability it may have to that Person or any other Person under the ADGM Founding Law or FSMR.

3.2.3 Where a Rule requires information to be sent to a Client, the Authorised Person must provide that information directly to the Client and not to another Person, unless it is on the written instructions of the Client.
