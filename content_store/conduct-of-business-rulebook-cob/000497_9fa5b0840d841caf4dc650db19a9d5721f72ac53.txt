Guidance

1.

The Regulator may require Third Party Providers to demonstrate the safety and integrity of their Interfacing Systems by, inter alia, connecting to systems operated by the Regulator or by conducting such tests on the Interfacing Systems as the Regulator may specify.

2.

An attestation provided under Rule 20.14.3 is not a legally binding instrument. It places personal responsibility on the Senior Executive Officer of the Third Party Provider to ensure that all reasonable steps have been taken. Should operational or security incidents occur, the Regulator will consider whether the Senior Executive Officer had misled the Regulator in line with Article 221 of the Financial Services and Markets Regulations 2015 on Misleading the Regulator.

3.

In considering whether a person meets the criteria of the qualified independent third party referred to in Rule 20.14.3(5), the Regulator will have regard to, inter alia, the experience and expertise of the person in conducting such assessments whether in the UAE or internationally.
