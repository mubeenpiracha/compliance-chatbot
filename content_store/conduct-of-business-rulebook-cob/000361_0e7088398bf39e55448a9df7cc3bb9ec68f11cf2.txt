Guidance

1.

Payment Service Providers are distinct from other Authorised Persons undertaking the Regulated Activity of Providing Money Services as they offer to their customers one or more of Payment Accounts, Payment Instruments and Stored Value.

2.

Payment Service Users are not considered to be Clients of Payment Service Providers insofar as Chapter 19 does not distinguish between Retail Clients and Professional Clients in relation to the conduct of Payment Services so Chapter 2 does not therefore apply to Payment Services Providers.

3.

Chapters 14 and 16 are applicable to the safekeeping of Relevant Money by Payment Service Providers, being either Money retained in the Payment Account of the Payment Service User, or Money held in a segregated manner by the Payment Service Provider for the purpose of funding the redemption of Stored Value issued to the Payment Service User in connection with the conduct of Payment Services.
