Guidance

1. The Climate Transition Portfolio Investment Requirement may be met by investment in any combination of Eligible Climate Transition Portfolio Assets meeting the criteria in any one of Rules 3.8.12(a) to (e).

2. When considering whether assets meet the criteria in Rule 3.8.12, an Investment Manager should consider not only the investment in the immediate asset but also any underlying assets. For example, where investing in Units, the Investment Manager should consider whether the underlying assets of the Fund would meet the Climate Transition Portfolio Investment Requirement.

3. An asset should be subject to ongoing assessment to ensure it meets the criteria in Rule 3.8.12. For example, a green bond that fails to retain the positive opinion of a third party following its post-issuance review should be reassessed by the Investment Manager in terms of whether it can still be considered an Eligible Climate Transition Portfolio Asset. An Investment Manager should document its considerations regarding ongoing assessment of the appropriateness of classifying assets as Eligible Climate Transition Portfolio Assets.
