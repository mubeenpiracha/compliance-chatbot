If an Authorised Person is aware that a Client, with or for whom it is intending to carry on a Regulated Activity where this involves provision of a service to a Client, is acting as an agent for another Person (the “second person”) in relation to a particular Transaction, then unless the Client is another Authorised Person, a Recognised Body, a Remote Body, or a Regulated Financial Institution, the Authorised Person must also treat that second person as its Client in relation to that Transaction.

If an Authorised Person intends to carry on any Regulated Activity where this involves provision of a service or product to a Client which is a trust, it must unless otherwise provided in the Rules, treat the trustee of the trust, and not the beneficiaries of the trust, as its Client.
