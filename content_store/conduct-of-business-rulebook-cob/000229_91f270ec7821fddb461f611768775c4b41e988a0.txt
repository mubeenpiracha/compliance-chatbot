9.14 Remuneration and reporting lines

9.14.1 A Credit Rating Agency must have remuneration structures and strategies which, amongst other things, are consistent with the business objectives and identified risk parameters within which the Authorised Person operates, and provide for effective alignment of risk outcomes and the roles and functions of the relevant Employees. The requirements set out in this section are designed to augment those remuneration requirements set out in GEN (in particular, Appendix 1.2 of GEN).

9.14.2 A Credit Rating Agency must ensure that Employees involved in the provision of Credit Ratings have reporting lines and remuneration arrangements that are designed to eliminate, or effectively manage, actual and potential conflicts of interest.

9.14.3 A Credit Rating Agency must ensure that its Employees are not remunerated, or their performance evaluated, based on the amount of revenue generated or expected from the Credit Ratings in which the Employee was involved.
