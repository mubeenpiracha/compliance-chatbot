6.5.3 Requirements

In determining whether an Authorised Person has taken reasonable care to provide the best overall price for a Client in accordance with Rule 6.5.2 the Regulator will have regard to whether an Authorised Person has:

(a)

discounted any fees and charges previously disclosed to the Client;

(b)

not taken a Mark-up or Mark-down from the price at which it Executed the Transaction, unless this is disclosed to the Client; and

(c)

had regard to price competition or the availability of a range of price sources for the execution of its Clients' Transactions. In the case where the Authorised Person has access to prices of different Recognised Investment Exchanges, Remote Investment Exchanges, MTFs or OTFs or its own available proprietary prices, it must Execute the Transaction at the best overall price available having considered other relevant factors.

6.5.4

If another Person is responsible for the execution of a Transaction, an Authorised Person may rely on that Person to provide best execution where that Person has undertaken to provide best execution in accordance with this section.
