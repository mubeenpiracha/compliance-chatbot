has opted not to be classified as a Retail Client.

Guidance

1. A legal structure or vehicle established for investment purposes for an individual who are themselves a Professional Client may not opt to be treated as a Retail Client, as that right belongs to the Professional Client for whose purposes the legal structure or vehicle is set up.

2. A joint account holder for whom investment decisions are being made by a primary account holder who is a Professional Client does not per se have a right to opt to be classified as a Retail Client with regard to the operation of the joint account, but may withdraw confirmation given to have decisions on behalf of him made by the Professional Client who is the primary account holder of the joint account. In such event, the Authorised Person must ensure that the withdrawing individual is no longer classified as a Professional Client, and that the operating of the joint account will not reflect treatment as a Professional Client until such time as the assets of the withdrawing joint account holder are withdrawn from the joint account.
