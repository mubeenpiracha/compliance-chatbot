(c)

any Person who has a significant business or other relationship with the Rating Subject or any Person referred to above.

9.12.3 A Credit Rating Agency may carry out activities which are ancillary to its Credit Rating

activities to a Rating Subject or a Related Party of the Rating Subject where it:

(a)

has a clear definition of what services it considers as ancillary activities;

(b)

documents why the carrying on of such activities are considered not to raise any conflicts of interest with its Credit Rating activities; and

(c)

has in place adequate mechanisms to minimise the potential for any conflicts of interest arising.

9.12.4 Ancillary activities include, for example, market forecasts, estimates of economic trends, pricing analysis and other general data analysis, as well as related distribution services. These ancillary activities can be carried out for the benefit of Rating Subjects and their Related Parties where the requirements in this provision are met. These activities are also unlikely to constitute Regulated Activities.
