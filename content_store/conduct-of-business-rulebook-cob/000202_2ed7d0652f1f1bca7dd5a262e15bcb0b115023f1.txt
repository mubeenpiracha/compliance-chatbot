Integrity of the Rating Process

9.5.1 A Credit Rating Agency and its Employees must comply with all applicable laws and

regulations governing its activities in each jurisdiction in which it operates.

9.5.2 A Credit Rating Agency and its Employees must deal fairly and honestly with issuers,

investors, other market participants, and the public.

9.5.3 A Credit Rating Agency's analysts must be held to high standards of integrity, and a Credit

Rating Agency must not employ individuals with demonstrably compromised integrity.

9.5.4 A Credit Rating Agency and its Employees must not, either implicitly or explicitly, give any assurance or guarantee of a particular rating prior to a rating assessment. This does not preclude a Credit Rating Agency from developing prospective assessments used in structured finance and similar transactions.
