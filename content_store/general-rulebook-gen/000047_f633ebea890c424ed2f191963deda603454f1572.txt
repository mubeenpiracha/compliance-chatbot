Information barriers

When an Authorised Person establishes and Maintains an information barrier (that is, an arrangement that requires information held by an Authorised Person in the course of carrying on one part of the business to be withheld from, or not to be used for, persons with or for whom its acts in the course of carrying on another part of its business) it may:

(1)

withhold or not use the information held; and

(2)

for that purpose, permit persons employed in the first part of its business to withhold the information held from those employed in that other part of the business,

but only to the extent that the business of one of those parts involves the carrying on of Regulated Activities or ancillary activities.

Information may also be withheld or not used by an Authorised Person when this is required by an established arrangement Maintained between different parts of the business (of any kind) in the same group. This provision does not affect any requirement to transmit or use information that may arise apart from the rules in COBS.
