Records

(1)

An Authorised Person must make and retain records of matters and dealings, including Accounting Records and corporate governance practices which are the subject of requirements and standards under the Regulations and Rules.

(2)

Such records, however stored, must be capable of reproduction on paper within a reasonable period not exceeding three Business Days.

Subject to Rule 3.3.36, the records required by Rule 3.3.34 or by any other Rule in this

Rulebook must be maintained by the Authorised Person in the English language.
