 Body Corporate and extends that concept to the ultimate Holding Company of the Body Corporate.

2.

Pursuant to Rule 8.8.2(1)(c), a Person becomes a Controller if that Person can exert significant management influence over an Authorised Person. The ability to exert significant management influence can arise even where a Person, alone or with his Associates, controls less than 10% of the Shares or voting rights of the Authorised Person or a Holding Company of that Authorised Person. Similarly, a Person may be able to exert significant management influence where such Person does not Hold Shares or voting rights but has current exercisable rights to acquire Shares or voting rights, such as under Options.
