Appointment and termination of Auditors

Each Authorised Person and Recognised Body must:

(1)

notify the Regulator of the appointment of an Auditor in such form as the Regulator shall prescribe; and

(2)

prior to the appointment of the Auditor, take reasonable steps to ensure that the Auditor has the required skills, resources and experience to audit the business of the Authorised Person or Recognised Body for which the auditor has been appointed.

Each Authorised Person and Recognised Body must notify the Regulator immediately if the appointment of the Auditor is or is about to be terminated, or on the resignation of its Auditor, in such form as the Regulator shall prescribe.

Each Authorised Person and Recognised Body must appoint an Auditor to fill any vacancy in the office of Auditor and ensure that the replacement Auditor can take up office at the time the vacancy arises or as soon as reasonably practicable.

Each Authorised Person and Recognised Body must comply with any request by the Regulator to replace an Auditor previously appointed by that Authorised Person or Recognised Body.
