Guidance

In considering whether an Approved Person remains fit and proper, the Authorised Person should consider the factors outlined in section 2.3 of the GPM. The Authorised Person must also comply with the notification requirements in Rule 8.10 where it considers that an Approved Person is no longer fit and proper to perform their role.

Before lodging an application with the Regulator to perform a Controlled Function, an Authorised Person must make reasonable enquiries as to an individual's fitness and propriety to carry out a Controlled Function.

An Authorised Person must not lodge an application in accordance with Rule 5.6.1 if it has reasonable grounds to believe that the individual is not fit and proper to carry out the Controlled Function.
