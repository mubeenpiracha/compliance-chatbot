General provisions

A Representative Office must have a place of business within the geographical

boundaries of ADGM.

A Representative Office must not:

(1)

share an office with another Authorised Person;

(2)

represent anyone other than itself or a member of its Group; or

(3)

permit any staff member to be an Employee of another Authorised Person or Recognised Body.

Guidance

The Regulator would generally not consider a Representative Office to be sharing an office with an Authorised Person if that Representative Office were located in serviced offices which were also the place of business of an Authorised Person.
