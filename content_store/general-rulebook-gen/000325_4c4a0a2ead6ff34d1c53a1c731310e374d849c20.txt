Remuneration of Persons Undertaking Key Control Functions

5.

Any performance based component of Remuneration of Persons Undertaking Key Control Functions as well as other Employees undertaking activities under the direction and supervision of those Persons should not be linked to the performance of any business units which are subject to their control or oversight. For example, where risk and compliance functions are embedded in a business unit, a clear distinction should be drawn between the Remuneration structure applicable to those Persons Undertaking Key Control Functions and the Employees undertaking activities under their direction and supervision on the one hand and the other Employees in the business unit on the other hand. This may be achieved by separating the pools from which Remuneration is paid to the two groups of Employees, particularly where such Remuneration comprises performance based variable Remuneration.
