Guidance

1.

Maintaining a Trade Repository is not a separate Regulated Activity but may be carried on by an Authorised Person or Recognised Body which has a Financial Services Permission, or Recognition Order with a designation permitting it to do so. An Authorised Person or Recognised Body maintaining a Trade Repository is subject to some specific requirements relating to that activity, which are set out in Appendix 2.

2.

The functions of a Trade Repository promote increased transparency and integrity of information, particularly for centrally cleared OTC Derivatives. Transaction reporting requirements in ADGM exist in section 146 of FSMR which require reporting to Trade Repositories. These requirements are yet to be triggered by the Regulator.

3.

An Authorised Person or Recognised Body does not carry on the activities of a Trade Repository to the extent that it maintains records of transactions pursuant to the record keeping requirements applicable to that Authorised Person or Recognised Body (such as those relating to transactions carried out on behalf of the Authorised Personâ€™s Clients, or transactions carried out on the facilities of a Recognised Body).
