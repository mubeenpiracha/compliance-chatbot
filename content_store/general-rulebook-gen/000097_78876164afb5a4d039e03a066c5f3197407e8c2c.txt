Privileged access rights or permissions (i.e. rights and permissions to perform security-related functions that ordinary users are not authorised to perform, including rights and permissions to administrator accounts) should be limited to the extent possible and assigned to user credentials different from those used for regular business activities. Regular business activities should not be performed using privileged user credentials.

The process of performing regular reviews of access and permissions should facilitate the identification of dormant and redundant accounts as well as the detection of unauthorised access rights or permissions.
