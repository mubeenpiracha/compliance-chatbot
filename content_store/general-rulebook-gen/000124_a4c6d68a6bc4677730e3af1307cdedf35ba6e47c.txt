Guidance

1.

In considering the location of an Authorised Person or Recognised Body's head office, the Regulator will judge matters on a case by case basis, having regard to the location of its Directors, Partners and Senior Management and to the main location of its day-to-day operational, control, management and administrative arrangements.

2.

An Authorised Person, Recognised Body or Applicant for a Financial Services Permission or for a Recognition Order which does not satisfy the Regulator with respect to the location of its offices will, on this point alone, not be considered fit and proper or able to satisfy the Recognition Requirements.
