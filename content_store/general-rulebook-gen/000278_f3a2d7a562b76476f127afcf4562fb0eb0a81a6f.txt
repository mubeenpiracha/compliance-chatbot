Guidance

1.

Because of the limited nature of the Regulated Activity of Operating a Representative Office, much of the ADGM Rulebook has been disapplied for Representative Offices. While most of the key provisions applying to a Representative Office are contained in these Rules, a Representative Office should ensure that it complies with and has regard to other relevant provisions in other applicable ADGM Rulebooks including AML. The application section of each Rulebook sets out which chapters, if any, apply to a Representative Office.

2.

A Representative Office should also ensure that it complies with and has regard to relevant provisions of FSMR and MKT. FSMR gives the Regulator a number of important powers in relation to Authorised Persons including powers of supervision and enforcement.

3.

The Regulated Activity of Operating a Representative Office is defined in Schedule 1 of FSMR. By virtue of this Schedule, the Regulated Activity of Operating a Representative Office is a stand-alone Regulated Activity.
