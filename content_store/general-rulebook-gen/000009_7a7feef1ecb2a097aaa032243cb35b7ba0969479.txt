 its business to withhold the information held from those employed in that other part of the business,

but only to the extent that the business of one of those parts involves the carrying on of Regulated Activities or ancillary activities.

GEN VER11.290725

Information may also be withheld or not used by an Authorised Person when this is required by an established arrangement Maintained between different parts of the business (of any kind) in the same group. This provision does not affect any requirement to transmit or use information that may arise apart from the rules in COBS.

For the purposes of this Rule, "Maintains" includes taking reasonable steps to ensure that the arrangements remain effective and are adequately monitored, and must be interpreted accordingly.

Acting in conformity with Rule 3.3.25 does not amount to Market Abuse.

When any of the rules of COBS apply to an Authorised Person that acts with knowledge, the Authorised Person will not be taken to act with knowledge for the purposes of that rule if none of the relevant individuals involved on behalf of the Authorised Person acts with that knowledge as a result of arrangements established under Rule 3.3.25.

When an Authorised Person manages a conflict of interest using the arrangements in Rule 3.3.25 which take the form of an information barrier, individuals on the other side of the wall will not be regarded as being in possession of knowledge denied to them as a result of the information barrier.

any equivalent principles or regulations the Authorised Person is subject to in its home country jurisdiction.

3.

Rule 3.5 contains additional requirements that apply to an Authorised Person that receives services directly from a third party or a subcontractor of a third party which involve accessing the Authorised Personâ€™s IT Systems or Networks or accessing or processing its data.
