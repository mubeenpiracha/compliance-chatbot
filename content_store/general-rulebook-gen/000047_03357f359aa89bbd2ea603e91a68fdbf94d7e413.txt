Guidance

1.

A Person who acquires control of or increases the level of control in an Authorised Person without the prior Regulator approval or breaches a condition of approval is in breach of the Rules. See Rules 8.8.13 and 8.8.14 for the actions that the Regulator may take in such circumstances.

2.

In assessing a proposed acquisition or increase in control, the Regulator may generally consider the suitability of the notice-giver, the financial soundness of the acquisition in order to ensure the sound and prudent management of the Authorised Person, and the likely influence that the notice-giver will have on the Authorised Person.

3.

In determining whether to object to a proposed acquisition, the Regulator may consider:

83

GEN VER11.290725

a.

the reputation of the notice-giver or of any person who will direct the business of the Authorised Person as a result of the acquisition;

b.

the financial soundness of the notice-giver;

c.

whether the Authorised Person will be able to comply with its prudential requirements;

d.

where the Authorised Person is to become part of a Group as a result of the acquisition, whether the structure of such a Group will allow for effective supervision and the exchange of information with the Regulator where required;

e.

whether there are reasonable grounds to suspect that money laundering or terrorist financing has been, or may be, committed in connection with the proposed acquisition; and

f.

whether the proposed acquisition is contrary to one or more of the Regulatorâ€™s objectives.
