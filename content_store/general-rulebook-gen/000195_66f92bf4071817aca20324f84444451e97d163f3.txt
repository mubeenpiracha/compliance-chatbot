of the handling of the Complaint.

Guidance

1.

The Regulator considers seven days to be an adequate period in which an Authorised Person should be able to acknowledge most Complaints.

2.

The Regulator expects an update to be provided to the complainant in circumstances where the resolution of the Complaint is taking longer than 30 days.

Resolution of Complaints

Upon conclusion of an investigation of a Complaint, an Authorised Person must

promptly:

(1)

advise the complainant in writing of the resolution of the Complaint;

(2)

provide the complainant with clear terms of redress, if applicable; and

(3)

comply with the terms of redress if accepted by the complainant.

If the complainant is not satisfied with the terms of redress offered by the Authorised Person, the Authorised Person must inform the complainant of other avenues, if any, for resolution of the Complaint and provide him with the appropriate contact details upon request.
