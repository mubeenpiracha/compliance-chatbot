Guidance

The Regulator has exercised its power under section 189 of FSMR to exempt an Authorised Person or Recognised Body which is a Representative Office from the requirements in that section. As a result, in accordance with the terms of section 189 FSMR, the Representative Office also does not need to comply with other requirements in Part 15 of FSMR.
