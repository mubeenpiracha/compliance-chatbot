Guidance

IFR and Schedule 1 of FSMR contain a prohibition against an Authorised Person holding itself out as conducting Islamic Financial Business without first obtaining a Financial Services Permission. An Islamic Financial Institution may operate a Representative Office in ADGM but it is deemed not to be conducting Islamic Financial Business through its Representative Office. This is because of the limited nature of the financial services activity it is permitted to carry on and because it does not enter into client relationships in ADGM. Accordingly, there is no requirement to obtain an appropriate Financial Services Permission and IFR does not apply.
