8.8

Changes relating to control

(1)

This Rule applies, subject to (2) and (3), to:

(a)

an Authorised Person or Recognised Body; or

(b)

a Person who is, or is proposing to become, a Controller specified in Rule 8.8.2.

(2)

This Chapter does not apply to a Representative Office or a Person who is a Controller of such a Representative Office.

(3)

A Credit Rating Agency must comply with the requirements in this Rule as if it were a non-ADGM established company.

Guidance

The requirements in respect of notification of changes relating to control of Branches (i.e. non-ADGM established companies) are set out in Rule 8.8.10. Although some Credit Rating Agencies may be companies established in ADGM, such companies will only be subject to the notification requirements relating to their Controllers. Accordingly, regardless of whether a Credit Rating Agency is a company established in ADGM or a Branch operation, it is subject to the notification requirements only and not to the requirement for prior approval by the Regulator of changes relating to its Controllers.

Guidance

1.

For the purposes of these Rules, the relevant definition of a Holding Company is found in the Companies Regulations. That definition describes when one Body Corporate is considered to be a Holding Company or a Subsidiary of another Body Corporate and extends that concept to the ultimate Holding Company of the Body Corporate.

2.

Pursuant to Rule 8.8.2(1)(c), a Person becomes a Controller if that Person can exert significant management influence over an Authorised Person. The ability to exert significant management influence can arise even where a Person, alone or with his Associates, controls less than 10% of the Shares or voting rights of the Authorised Person or a Holding Company of that Authorised Person. Similarly, a Person may be able to exert significant management influence where such Person does not Hold Shares or
