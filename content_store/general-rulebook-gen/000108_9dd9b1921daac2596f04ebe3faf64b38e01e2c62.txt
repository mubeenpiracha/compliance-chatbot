Guidance

1.

An Authorised Person should use a range of methods to test its IT Systems and Networks and processes and controls, such as:

a.

vulnerability assessments;

b.

scenario-based testing;

35

GEN VER11.290725

c.

penetration tests;

d.

bug bounty programs; or

e.

red team exercises,

taking into account the Authorised Personâ€™s Cyber Risk assessment under Rule 3.5.4(2).

2.

The frequency with which an Authorised Person should carry out testing will depend on the nature, scale and complexity of its business. It may be adequate to test annually for some Authorised Persons, for others more frequent testing may be required. The Regulator expects additional tests to be carried out whenever systems are updated or new systems are implemented, including when systems are changed to address vulnerabilities that have been identified during testing.
