Severance payments

9.

Where an Authorised Person or Recognised Body provides discretionary payouts on termination of employment ("severance payments", also called "golden parachutes"), such payment should generally be subject to appropriate limits or shareholder approval. In any case, such payouts should be aligned with the Authorised Person or Recognised Body's overall financial condition and performance over an appropriate time horizon and should not be payable in the case of failure or threatened failure of the Authorised Person or Recognised Body, particularly to an individual whose actions may have contributed to the failure or potential failure of the Authorised Person or Recognised Body.
