Guidance

1.

The details provided under Rule A7.1.4(b)(ii) should make it clear for each custody arrangement permitted or required on a facility, whether the arrangement involves Self- Custody of Security Tokens, or whether either the operator of the facility is responsible or a Third Part Digital Wallet Service Provider is responsible for safe custody of the relevant Security Tokens (see COB section 14.3).

2.

The details provided under Rule A7.1.4(b)(iii) should make clear whether a given Digital Wallet is web based, or otherwise connected to the internet (sometimes referred to as a ‘hot wallet’), or whether it is held on hardware that is not connected to the internet (sometimes referred to as a ‘cold wallet’). They should also explain the differing risks associated with hot wallets as opposed to cold wallets, such as those arising from increased risk of hacking attempts being made against hot wallets, and the risk of physical loss or theft associated with cold wallets.
