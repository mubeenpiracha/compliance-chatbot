MARKETS RULES (MKT)

67. Levels of remuneration for non-executive Directors should reflect the time commitment and responsibilities of their respective roles and the objectivity of judgement in their decision making required by them. In considering whether to grant share options to non- executive Directors, a Reporting Entity should consider whether the granting of the share options will impair the objectivity or independence of the non-executive Directors’ decision making.

68. Generally, where non-executive Directors’ remuneration include share options, rights resulting from the exercise of share options should be subject to appropriate retention and vesting periods, generally until at least one year after the non-executive Director leaves the Board.
