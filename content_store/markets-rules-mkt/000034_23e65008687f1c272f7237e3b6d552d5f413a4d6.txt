Guidance

1.

The terms “Applicant” and “Listed Entity” are defined in Rule 9.1.1(2).

2.

Rule 1.3.3 defines when an Applicant or Listed Entity is a SME. Under that Rule, such an Applicant or Listed Entity will be a SME unless the average aggregate market value of its listed shares exceeds $500 million for 90 consecutive days. If that occurs, it will cease to be a SME and will need to meet the same continuing obligations as any other Listed Entity.

3.

The DFSA may specify, for the purposes of the SME definition, the appropriate method to be used to calculate the aggregate market value of the Shares of an Applicant or a Listed Entity. A SME should have in place appropriate systems and controls to monitor the average aggregate market value of its listed Shares to determine if it ceases to be a SME under Rule
