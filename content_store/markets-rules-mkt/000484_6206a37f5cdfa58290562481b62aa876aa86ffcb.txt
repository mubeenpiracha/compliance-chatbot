Article 39(1) of the Law provides that a Reporting Entity must have a corporate governance framework which is adequate to promote prudent and sound management of the Reporting Entity in the long-term interest of the Reporting Entity and its shareholders. Accordingly, in providing its explanation in the annual report as noted in paragraph 2,, a Reporting Entity should aim to illustrate how its actual practices achieve compliance with the outcomes intended by Article 39(1) of the Law and the Principles, and thereby contribute to prudent and sound management of the Reporting Entity.
