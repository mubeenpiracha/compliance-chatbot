 transfer of Shares, if the DFSA is satisfied that this power would not disturb the market in those Shares.

Market capitalisation

9.3.9

(1)

An Applicant must ensure that the Securities which it seeks to list have an expected aggregate market value at the time of listing of at least:

(a)

$250 million for Shares; and

(b)

$2 million for Debentures.

(2)

The requirement in (1)(a) does not apply to an Applicant that is a SME.

Guidance

The DFSA may modify the threshold specified in Rule 9.3.9(1)(a) by reducing the aggregate market value required, where it is satisfied that it is appropriate in the circumstances to do so. When the DFSA

reduces that threshold it may also make a corresponding modification to the definition of a SME in Rule 1.3.3.

Shares in public hands

9.3.10 (1)

If an application is made for the admission of a class of Shares, a sufficient number of Shares of that class must, no later than the time of admission, be distributed to the public.

(2)

For the purposes of Rule (1), a sufficient number of Shares will be taken to have been distributed to the public when 25 per cent of the Shares for which application for admission has been made are in public hands.

(3)

For the purposes of Rules (1) and (2), Shares are not held in public hands if they are held, directly or indirectly by:

(a)

a Director of the Applicant or of any of its Subsidiary Undertakings;

(b)

a Person connected with a Director of the Applicant or any of its Subsidiary Undertakings;

(c)

the fund trustees of an employee share scheme or pension established for the benefit of any Directors or employees of the Applicant and its Subsidiary Undertakings;

(d)

any Person who under any agreement has a right to nominate a Person to the board of Directors of the Applicant; or

(e)

any Person or Persons in the same group or Persons acting in concert who have an interest in 5% or more of the Shares of the relevant class.

Guidance

The DFSA may waive or modify Rule 9.3.10(2) to accept a percentage lower than 25 per cent if it considers than the market will operate properly with a lower percentage in view of additional factors. Such additional factors might permit, for example, a lower percentage than 25% for a company with a large market capitalisation with a large number of Shares of the same class listed and where such Shares would nonetheless expect to have a wide distribution to the public and be liquid.

Lock-in for existing SME shareholders

9.3.11 (1)

A SME Applicant must ensure that all of its pre-listing shareholders have entered into a binding agreement not to dispose of any interest in its Securities for a period of 12 months from the date of admission of its Shares to the List.

(2)

The requirement in (1) does not apply to the disposal of any interest in Securities where the disposal:

(a)

is required pursuant to the order of a court of a competent jurisdiction;

(b)

results from the death of a pre-listing shareholder; or

(c)

is made in acceptance of a takeover offer for the SME, which is made after its Shares are listed and is open to all shareholders.

MKT/VER24/03-25

MARKETS RULES (MKT)

(3)

In (1) and (2), “pre-listing shareholder” means any Person who, immediately before the admission of the SME’s Shares to the List, holds a legal or beneficial interest, whether direct or indirect, in one or more Shares issued by that SME.

Whole class to be listed

9.3.12 An application for a class of Securities to be admitted to the List must:

(a)

if no Securities of that class are already admitted to the List, relate to all Securities of that class, issued or proposed to be issued; or

(b)

if Securities of that class are already admitted to the List, relate to all further Securities of that class, issued or proposed to be issued.

Settlement

9.3.13 To be admitted to the List:
