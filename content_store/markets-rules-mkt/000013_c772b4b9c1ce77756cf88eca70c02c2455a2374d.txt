Guidance

a.

A Person intending to apply to the DFSA for approval of a Prospectus pursuant to Rule 2.6.1(1) should consider submitting a draft Prospectus for preliminary review by the DFSA prior to formally submitting the Prospectus for DFSA approval. See the RPP Sourcebook for procedures for applying for DFSA approval.

2.

The formal approval of a Prospectus by the DFSA will not prevent the use by the DFSA of its powers, such as the stop order power in Article 25 of the Law, in circumstances where the need for such action is subsequently identified. For example, if the DFSA becomes aware, after the approval of the Prospectus, that it contains any misleading or deceptive information, or it breaches the Prospectus provisions in other respects, the DFSA may use its stop order power or take any other action as appropriate in the circumstances.

Publication of a prospectus

(1)

After a Prospectus has been approved by the DFSA, it must be made available to the public as soon as is reasonably practicable, and in any case, at a reasonable time in advance of, and at the latest at the beginning of, the making of the Prospectus Offer.

(2)

An Approved Prospectus is deemed to be made available to the public for the purposes of (1) when such a Prospectus is published:

(a)

in printed form, to be made available free of charge to the public at the registered office of any one or more of the following:

(i)

the Person making the Prospectus Offer;

(ii)

any Authorised Firm appointed by the Person in (a) to act as the placement or selling agent in respect of the offer; or

(iii)

if applicable, the relevant Authorised Market Institution on which the Securities are to be traded; or

(b)

in an electronic form on the website of any one or more Persons referred to in (a).

(3)

The content and format of the Prospectus made available to the public in accordance with (2) must at all times be identical to the version approved by the DFSA.
