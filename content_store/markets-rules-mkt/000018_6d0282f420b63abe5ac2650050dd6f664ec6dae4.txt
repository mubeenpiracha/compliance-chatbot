While most of this module does not apply to Crypto Tokens, it should be noted that GEN Rule 3A.2.1 prohibits an Offer to the Public of a Crypto Token unless it is a Recognised Crypto Token (i.e. a Crypto Token which the DFSA has recognised as meeting the criteria in GEN section 3A). In addition, as GEN Rule 3A.2.1 prohibits a Financial Service from being carried on in relation to a Crypto Token unless it is a Recognised Crypto Token, an MTF Operator will only be able to admit a Recognised Crypto Token to trading on a MTF and a Crypto Token Derivative if any underlying Crypto Token is a Recognised Crypto Token.
