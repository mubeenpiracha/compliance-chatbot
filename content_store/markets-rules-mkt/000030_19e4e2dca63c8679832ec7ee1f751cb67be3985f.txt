 or may have access to Inside Information acknowledge the legal and regulatory duties entailed, including dealing restrictions in relation to the Reporting Entityâ€™s Securities or any related Investments, and are aware of the sanctions attaching to the misuse or improper use or circulation of such information.

4.2.9 A Reporting Entity must nominate two individuals to be its main points of contact with the DFSA in relation to continuing disclosure and other obligations under this chapter.

Guidance

Framework for handling Inside Information

1.

The responsibility for ensuring that a Reporting Entity has an adequate overall policy on the handling of Inside Information lies with the Board of the Reporting Entity. Whilst responsibility for compliance with the continuing obligations set out in the Rules lies with the Reporting Entity, Directors should be aware that they may be held personally liable for breaching these Rules.

2.

Reporting Entities should have a consistent procedure for assessing whether information is Inside Information and should clearly identify those within the Reporting Entity who are responsible for the communication of this information to the market.

3.

Reporting Entities should put in place arrangements for maintaining the confidentiality of Inside Information before announcement. These should include adequate training for Employees in the handling, distribution and announcement of Inside Information as appropriate. Reporting Entities should, for example, guard against the risk of Inside Information being leaked to the market through selective disclosure of internal briefings or via trade journals. Where the Reporting Entity considers that this may have occurred, an announcement should be made immediately.

Inadvertent disclosure

4.

In situations where the Reporting Entity will be open to questioning that may be designed to elicit or may have the effect of eliciting Inside Information (such as during shareholders' meetings or dealing with analysts or journalists), the Reporting Entity should plan in advance how it will respond to such questions. If the Reporting Entity intends to disclose Inside Information at such a meeting, an announcement must be made before or at the same time as the meeting.
