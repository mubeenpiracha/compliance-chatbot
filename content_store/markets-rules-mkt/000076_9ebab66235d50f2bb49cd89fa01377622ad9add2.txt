Guidance

1.

In order to meet the obligation in Rule 2.6.5(1)(b), a financial intermediary should undertake a review of the Prospectus to ensure that it does not contain any obvious misleading or deceptive information or omissions that would be reasonably apparent to a financial intermediary assessing and analysing the Prospectus.

2.

The financial intermediary and the Issuer of the Securities may be able to rely on the defences provided in Articles 21 and 22 of the Law against any action brought against that Person for a breach of the requirements relating to the applicable Prospectus requirements.
