Guidance

a.

A Person intending to apply to the DFSA for approval of a Prospectus pursuant to Rule 2.6.1(1) should consider submitting a draft Prospectus for preliminary review by the DFSA prior to formally submitting the Prospectus for DFSA approval. See the RPP Sourcebook for procedures for applying for DFSA approval.

2.

The formal approval of a Prospectus by the DFSA will not prevent the use by the DFSA of its powers, such as the stop order power in Article 25 of the Law, in circumstances where the need for such action is subsequently identified. For example, if the DFSA becomes aware, after the approval of the Prospectus, that it contains any misleading or deceptive information, or it breaches the Prospectus provisions in other respects, the DFSA may use its stop order power or take any other action as appropriate in the circumstances.
