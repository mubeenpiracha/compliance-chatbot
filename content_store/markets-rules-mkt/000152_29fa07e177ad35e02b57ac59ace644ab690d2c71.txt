Reporting Entities should put in place arrangements for maintaining the confidentiality of Inside Information before announcement. These should include adequate training for Employees in the handling, distribution and announcement of Inside Information as appropriate. Reporting Entities should, for example, guard against the risk of Inside Information being leaked to the market through selective disclosure of internal briefings or via trade journals. Where the Reporting Entity considers that this may have occurred, an announcement should be made immediately.
