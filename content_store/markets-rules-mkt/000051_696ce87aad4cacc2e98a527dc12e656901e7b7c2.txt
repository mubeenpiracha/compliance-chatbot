Exempt Securities are Securities which a Person can have admitted to trading on an Authorised Market Institution without a Prospectus.

2.

The prohibition in Article 14(1)(b) of the Law does not apply, subject to the requirement in Rule 2.4.2, to the admission to trading on an Authorised Market Institution of Securities that are Exempt Securities under Rule 2.4.1.

2.4.1 For the purposes of Article 14(3)(b) of the Law the DFSA hereby prescribes the types

of Securities that are Exempt Securities:

(a)

Shares representing, over a period of 12 months, less than 10 per cent of the number of Shares of the same class already admitted to trading on the same Authorised Market Institution;

(b)

Shares issued in substitution for Shares of the same class already admitted to trading on the same Authorised Market Institution, if the issue of the Shares does not involve any increase in the issued capital;

(c)

Securities offered in connection with a Takeover by means of an exchange offer, if a document is available containing information which is regarded by the DFSA as being equivalent to that of a Prospectus;
