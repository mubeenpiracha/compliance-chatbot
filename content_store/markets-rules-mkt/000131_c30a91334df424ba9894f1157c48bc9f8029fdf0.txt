For the disclosure to be not misleading, false or deceptive, a Reporting Entity should provide information that is accurate, factual and complete. Any incomplete or inaccurate information, such as omission of relevant information, would be misleading or deceptive. Information should be provided in an easy to understand manner and not for promotional purposes. The use of imprecise and confusing language such as ‘double digit’ or ‘in excess of last year’ should be avoided as it does not allow investors to properly assess the information for the purpose of making an informed decision relating to the relevant Securities.

Where a Reporting Entity realises that it has or may have breached its continuous disclosure obligations, it should contact the DFSA to discuss the matter and seek guidance on remedying the situation and on taking steps to ensure that similar breaches are prevented from recurring.

A confidentiality agreement should not prevent an entity from complying with its obligations relating to the disclosure of Inside Information.
