Application to listed funds

1.

Where Units of a Fund are admitted to trading on an Authorised Market Institution, such a Fund is a Listed Fund. Where Units of a Fund that are Security Tokens are admitted to trading on an Alternative Trading System, but are not admitted to trading on an Authorised Market Institution or a Regulated Exchange, such a Fund is defined as an ATS Traded Fund. A reference to a Reporting Entity in relation to a Listed Fund or an ATS Traded Fund is a reference to the Fund Manager of that Fund, unless another person has been declared by the DFSA as the Reporting Entity of the Fund.

2.

Accordingly, any obligations of a Reporting Entity of a Listed Fund or an ATS Traded Fund are, unless the context requires otherwise, obligations imposed on the Reporting Entity in respect of the Listed Fund or the ATS Traded Fund, as the case may be (see Article 38(2) of the Law). Therefore, the obligations imposed by this Law and the Rules apply to the Governing Body of the Reporting Entity and to every member of the Governing Body in the manner specified in Rules 1.1.2 and 1.1.3.
