any other information regarding the Securities or the circumstances of the suspension or delisting which the DFSA requires.

(2)

The DFSA may impose such conditions or requirements as it considers appropriate on the suspension or delisting in (1).

Guidance

1.

A Listed Entity requesting delisting should submit such request in reasonable time for the DFSA to consider the request and satisfy the DFSA that a delisting would be appropriate.

2.

Examples of other information which the DFSA may require pursuant to Rule 9.6.3(1)(c) include proof or shareholder resolution if required, evidence of any announcement, circular or other document which the Listed Entity is relying on as part of its request to suspend or delist its Listing.

3.

A Listed Entity requesting cancellation of its listing should provide existing security holders with sufficient notice prior to the cancellation date in order to provide them with an opportunity to sell their Securities.

4.

An example of the type of condition the DFSA may impose pursuant to Rule 9.6.3(2) is the imposition of a time limit for the suspension.

Restoration of a listing

9.6.4 The DFSA may restore the listing of any Securities which have been suspended if it

considers that:

(a)

the smooth operation of the market is no longer jeopardised; or

(b)

where relevant, the suspension is no longer required to protect investors.

9.6.5 The DFSA may restore the listing of any Securities which have been suspended whether the restoration was requested by the relevant Listed Entity or at the DFSAâ€™s own initiative.

MARKETS RULES (MKT)

(c)

the Securities have been suspended from the Official List for more than six months;

(d)

it is necessary because the Securities have been subject to a merger, takeover or reverse takeover;

(e)

the Listing is a secondary Listing and the Securities have been cancelled on their primary listing or are no longer admitted to trading for such primary listing;

(f)

it is in the interests of the DIFC, including the interests of investors, potential investors or the DIFC capital markets; or

(g)

Guidance

In Rule 9.6.6(b), an example of a breach of the continuing obligations which may warrant a delisting by the DFSA would be where the percentage of shares in public hands falls below 25% or such lower percentage as the DFSA may permit. The DFSA may, however, allow a reasonable time to restore the percentage unless this is precluded by the need to maintain the smooth operation of the market or to protect investors.
