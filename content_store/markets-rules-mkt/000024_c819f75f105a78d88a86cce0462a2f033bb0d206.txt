(iv)

Guidance

1.

A Person is regarded as exercising significant influence over a Reporting Entity, for example, if that Person is a consultant or adviser to the Reporting Entity.

2.

Any transactions between a Subsidiary of a Reporting Entity and a Related Party is included within the definition of a Related Party Transaction. This is because a Related Party may, through the Reporting Entity, be able to influence terms which are more favourable to the Related Party when transacting with the subsidiary. .Such transactions could be detrimental to the interests of the Reporting Entity.

Related party transaction procedures

(a)

if the value of a Related Party Transaction is greater than 5% of value of the net assets of the Reporting Entity as stated in its most recent financial reports, it does not enter into such a transaction unless the transaction has been put to shareholder approval and has received prior approval by a majority of the shareholders in voting of the Reporting Entity;

(b)

if the value of the Related Party Transaction is less than the 5% threshold referred to in (a), it gives to the DFSA a notice as soon as possible after the transaction of the relevant terms and the basis on which such terms are considered fair and reasonable, supported by a written confirmation by an independent third party acceptable to the DFSA; or

(c)

if the cumulative value of a series of Related Party Transactions with the same Related Party reaches the 5% threshold referred to in (a) in any 12 month period, it does not enter into the last of the series of the transactions unless such proposed action has been put to shareholder approval and received approval by a majority of the shareholders in voting of the Reporting Entity.
