 to one with any other professional adviser. In the Policy Statement the DFSA confirms its view that the compliance adviser role is merely to advise and assist the Reporting Entity to comply with its continuing regulatory responsibilities, all of which remain the responsibility of the Reporting Entity.

3.

The DFSA will also usually require a SME applying for admission of its Shares to the List to appoint a compliance adviser as a condition of that admission and its ongoing listing. The DFSA will expect the compliance advisor to have sufficient senior, competent staff and a proven track record of relevant corporate finance transaction experience to enable it to advise the SME properly about the listing process and its ongoing obligations as a Reporting Entity.

Appointment of a compliance adviser

7.2.2 The DFSA may, pursuant to Article 49(1) of the Law, require a Person to:

(a)

appoint a compliance adviser; or

(b)

replace a compliance adviser already appointed.

7.2.3

(1)

A Person required to appoint a compliance adviser must, prior to making the appointment:

(a)

take reasonable steps to ensure that the proposed compliance adviser has the required knowledge, experience, qualifications and resources to carry out its obligations under the Rules;

MARKETS RULES (MKT)

(b)

notify the DFSA of the proposed compliance adviser’s name and business address; and

(c)

take reasonable steps to ensure that the proposed compliance adviser and its relevant Employees are independent and that any conflicts of interest are appropriately managed.

(2)

If requested by the DFSA, a Person appointing a compliance adviser must provide the DFSA with such information as it may require including information regarding knowledge, experience, qualifications and resources of the compliance adviser.

(3)

A Person required to appoint a compliance adviser must notify the DFSA if it becomes aware, or has reason to believe, that the compliance adviser or its relevant Employees have a conflict of interest which has not been appropriately managed.

Compliance adviser appointed to assist a SME

7.2.3A The DFSA may, by written notice, require a SME to appoint a compliance adviser to assist the SME in meeting its obligations under the Law and the Rules, both when it applies for admission of its Shares to the List and on an ongoing basis when its Shares have been admitted to the List.

Guidance

Where a SME is required to appoint a compliance adviser on an ongoing basis under Rule 7.2.3A, it must ensure that the compliance adviser continues to perform that role unless the SME receives written notice from the DFSA that the requirement is withdrawn. The DFSA will generally not withdraw such a requirement unless the SME can demonstrate to the DFSA’s satisfaction that:

(a)

the SME’s Shares have been admitted to trading on an Authorised Market Institution for at least two years;

(b)

the ongoing obligations for trading on that Authorised Market Institution have been complied with during that period; and

(c)

the SME has sufficient resources in place to comply with its obligations under the Law and the Rules without the assistance of a compliance adviser.

Compliance adviser appointed to assist for a specified period

7.2.4

(1)

The DFSA may, by written notice, require a Reporting Entity to appoint a compliance adviser for a specified period to assist the Reporting Entity in meeting its continuing obligations under the Law and the Rules.

(2)

A Reporting Entity that is required to appoint a compliance adviser in accordance with the requirements in this section must ensure that a compliance adviser continues to fulfil the role of compliance adviser until such time as the DFSA advises the Reporting Entity in writing that a compliance adviser is no longer required.

Obligations of a reporting entity in relation to its compliance adviser

7.2.5 Where a Person required to appoint a compliance adviser is advised by its compliance adviser that it is failing or has failed to comply with its obligations under the Law and the Rules, the Person must without undue delay:

(a)

(b)

if the Person does not or is unable to rectify the failure as soon as practicable notify the DFSA of that fact.

7.2.6 A Person required to appoint a compliance adviser must provide to the DFSA any information in such form and within such time as the DF
