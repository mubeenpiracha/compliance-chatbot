 its worsening financial condition and is limited to the fact or substance of the negotiations to deal with such a situation. A Reporting Entity is also not permitted to delay disclosure of Inside Information on the basis that its position in subsequent negotiations to deal with the situation will be jeopardised by the disclosure of its financial condition.

3.

Where the DFSA considers that the reliance of permitted exceptions under Rule 6.5.4 is not in the interests of actual or potential investors, market integrity or the DIFC, it may direct the Reporting Entity of a Listed Fund to make either a holding announcement or full market disclosure. The DFSA may, in addition, require the Authorised Market Institution in which the Units are traded to suspend trading of the relevant Units.

Control of inside information

6.5.6 A Reporting Entity of a Listed Fund must establish effective arrangements to deny access to Inside Information to Persons other than those who require it for the exercise of their functions within the Reporting Entity or the Listed Fund.

6.5.7 A Reporting Entity of a Listed Fund must establish and maintain adequate systems and controls to enable it to identify at all times any Person working for it under a contract of employment or otherwise, who has or may reasonably be likely to have access to Inside Information relating to the Reporting Entity or the Listed Fund as is applicable, whether on a regular or occasional basis.

6.5.8 A Reporting Entity of a Listed Fund must take the necessary measures to ensure that its Directors, Members of the Governing Body and Employees who have or may have access to Inside Information acknowledge the legal and regulatory duties entailed, and are aware of the sanctions attaching to the misuse or improper use or circulation of such information.

6.5.9 A Reporting Entity of a Listed Fund must nominate two individuals to be its main points of contact with the DFSA in relation to continuing disclosure and other obligations under this chapter.
