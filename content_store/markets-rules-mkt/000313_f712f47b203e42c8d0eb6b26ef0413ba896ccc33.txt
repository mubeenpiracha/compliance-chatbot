A Listed Entity should provide the DFSA with at least 14 clear days in which to review a proposal for the purchase of its own Shares. The more complex a proposal, the more time that will be required by the DFSA to review and approve the proposal.

2.

A Listed Entity which proposes to purchase up to 15 per cent of any class of its Shares may do so from specific investors or by way of a Share repurchase programme.
