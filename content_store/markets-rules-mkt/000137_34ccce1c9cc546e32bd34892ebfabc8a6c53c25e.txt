Relationship between continuous disclosure and periodic disclosures

13.

Periodic disclosures by Reporting Entities are required in a number of circumstances, and examples can include interim and annual financial reports and accounts, prospectuses, bidder’s statements and target’s statements.

14.

In the course of preparing these disclosure documents, Reporting Entities may become aware of Inside Information which was previously insufficiently precise to warrant disclosure. In such circumstances, a Reporting Entity should not defer releasing that information until the periodic disclosure or other document is finalised. In such circumstances, a Reporting Entity is expected to make an announcement containing the Inside Information as soon as possible.
