MARKETS RULES (MKT)

(a)

the information is provided in confidence and must not be used or be allowed to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it is provided; and

(b)

the recipient must take reasonable steps to ensure that the recipient or any Person having access to the information through the recipient does not deal in the relevant Securities, or any other related Investment, or disclose such information without legitimate reason, prior to market disclosure of that information by the Reporting Entity.

(4) Where a Reporting Entity makes selective disclosure of Inside Information pursuant to (1), it must ensure that a full announcement is made to the market as soon as possible, and in any event, when it becomes aware or has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information has or may have come to the knowledge of any Person or Persons other than those to whom the selective disclosure was made.

Guidance

1.

It is likely that Inside Information will be made known to certain Employees of the Reporting Entity. A Reporting Entity should put in place procedures to ensure that Employees do not disclose such information, whether or not inadvertently, and that Employees are adequately trained in the identification and handling of Inside Information (see Rules 4.2.6 â€“ 4.2.7 and associated Guidance).

2.

Rule 4.2.3 does not excuse a Reporting Entity from its overriding obligation to disclose Inside Information as soon as possible pursuant to Rule 4.2.1. A Reporting Entity which proposes to delay public disclosure of Inside Information should refer to Rule 4.2.4, which sets out the limited disclosure exceptions permitted.

Disclosure exceptions

(1) A Reporting Entity need not, subject to (2), make disclosure of information pursuant to Rule 4.2.1, where, in the reasonable opinion of the Reporting Entity, the disclosure required by that Rule would:

(a)

be unduly detrimental to the legitimate interests of the Reporting Entity; or

(b)

disclose commercially sensitive material.

(2) Where a Reporting Entity intends not to make the disclosure pursuant to (1), it

must immediately file with the DFSA a confidential report which:

(a)

contains all the information which it seeks not to disclose and the reasons for non-disclosure; and

(b)

is in the English language and, where any documents accompanying the report are not in the English language, an English translation of such documents.

(3) The DFSA may:

(a) specify the period during which disclosure of the information included in

the confidential report need not be disclosed to the markets; and

(b) extend the period referred to in (a) upon application by the Reporting

Entity.
