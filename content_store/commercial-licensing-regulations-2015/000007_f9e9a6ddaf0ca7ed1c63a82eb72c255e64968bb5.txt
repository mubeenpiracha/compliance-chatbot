The Registrar may require an applicant to provide information which the applicant is required to provide to it under this section in such form, or to verify it in such a way, as the Registrar may direct.

The Board may make rules requiring the payment to the Registrar of such fees, in connection with applications made under this Part, as are specified in the rules.

The Registrar may reject an application which is not accompanied by the payment to the Registrar of the fees due on such application.
