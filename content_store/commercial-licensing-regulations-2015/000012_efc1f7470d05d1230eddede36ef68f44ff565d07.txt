Nothing prevents the Registrar from appointing a person who is a member of its staff as an investigator.

An investigator must make a report of his investigation to the Registrar.

The Registrar may, by a direction to an investigator, control -

(a)

the scope of the investigation;

(b)

the period during which the investigation is to be conducted;

(c)

the conduct of the investigation; and

(d)

the reporting of the investigation.

A direction may, in particular -

(a)

confine the investigation to particular matters;

(b)

extend the investigation to additional matters;

(c)

require the investigator to discontinue the investigation or to take only such steps as are specified in the direction;

(d)

require the investigator to make such interim reports as are so specified.

(9)

If there is a change in the scope or conduct of the investigation and, in the opinion of the Registrar, the person subject to investigation is likely to be significantly prejudiced by not being made aware of it, that person must be given written notice of the change.
