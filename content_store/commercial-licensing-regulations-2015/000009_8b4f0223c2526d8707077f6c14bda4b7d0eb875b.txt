Publication of directions under section 23

Subject to subsection (2), a direction must be published by the Registrar in the way appearing to the Registrar to be best calculated for bringing it to the attention of -

(a)

persons likely to be affected by it; and

(b)

persons who are, in the opinion of the Registrar, likely to make an application for a similar direction.

Subsection (1) does not apply if the Registrar is satisfied that it is inappropriate or unnecessary to publish the direction.

In deciding whether it is satisfied as mentioned in subsection (2), the Registrar must -

(a)

consider whether the publication of the direction would be detrimental to the interests of the Abu Dhabi Global Market; and

(b)

consider whether publication of the direction would prejudice, to an unreasonable degree, the commercial interests of the person concerned or any other member of the person's immediate group, including whether it would be possible to avoid such prejudice by publishing the direction without disclosing the identity of the person concerned.

"Direction" means a direction under section 23.

Limit on effect of contravening rules

A contravention of any rule made by the Board under these Regulations does not by itself make any transaction void or unenforceable.

Rule-making instruments

Any power conferred on the Board to make rules pursuant to these Regulations is exercisable in writing.

An instrument by which rules are made by the Board ("a rule-making instrument") must specify the provision of these Regulations under which the rules are made.

To the extent that a rule-making instrument does not comply with subsection (2), it is void.
