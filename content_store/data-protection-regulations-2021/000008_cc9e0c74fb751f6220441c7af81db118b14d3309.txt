the existence of the rights set out in sections 13 to 16, 18 and 19;

(d)

where Processing is based on either section 5(1)(a) or 7(2)(a),

(i)

the existence of the right to withdraw Consent at any time; and

that the lawfulness of any Processing based on Consent prior to that withdrawal will not be affected by the subsequent withdrawal of Consent;

the existence of automated decision-making, including Profiling, referred to in sections 20(1) and 20(4) and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such Processing for the Data Subject.

the provision of such information proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort (having regard to the number of Data Subjects, the age of the data and any appropriate safeguards adopted), in particular for processing for Archiving and Research Purposes or in so far as the obligation referred to in section 12(1) is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that Processing, provided that the Controller takes appropriate measures to protect the Data Subject's rights and legitimate interests, including making the information publicly available;

obtaining or disclosure is expressly required by Applicable Law which provides appropriate measures to protect the Data Subject's legitimate interests; or
