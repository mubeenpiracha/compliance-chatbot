the Personal Data has to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Applicable Law to which the Controller is subject.

(2) Where the Controller has made the Personal Data public and is obliged pursuant to section 15(1) to erase the Personal Data, the Controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, must take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform Controllers which are Processing the Personal Data that the Data Subject has requested the erasure by such Controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, that Personal Data.

(3) Sections 15(1) and 15(2) will not apply to the extent that Processing is necessary:

(b)

for reasons of public interest in the area of public health in accordance with sections 7(2)(d) and 7(2)(e);

(d)

for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

(4) Where erasure of Personal Data is not feasible for technical reasons, then the Controller is not in violation of these Regulations for failing to comply with a request for erasure of the Personal Data under section 15(1), if:

(a)

the Controller collected the Personal Data from the Data Subject; and

(b)

the information provided to the Data Subject under section 11(2)(h) was explicit, clear and prominent with respect to the manner of Processing the Personal Data and expressly stated that erasure of the Personal Data at the request of the Data Subject would not be feasible.
