 Individual 1, being an indirect owner of 100% of Company A is the beneficial owner.

Example 5: Indirect Ownership

In this example, - Company A is a private company limited by shares registered in ADGM. - Company A is 50% owned by Body Corporate 1 and 50% owned by Individual 1 - Body Corporate 1 is 100% owned by Individual 2

Beneficial Owners: Individual 1 and Individual 2, being a direct owner and indirect owner of 50% each respectively of Company A are the beneficial owners.

Example 6: Indirect Ownership

In this example, - Company A is a private company limited by shares registered in ADGM.

Company A is 50% owned by Body Corporate 1 and 50% owned by Body Corporate 2. - Body Corporate 1 is 100% owned by Individual 1 and Body Corporate 2 is 100% owned by Individual 2.

Beneficial Owners: Individual 1 and Individual 2, being indirect owners of 50% each of Company A are the beneficial owners (the control test must also be applied however for additional beneficial owners).

Example 7: Indirect Ownership

In this example,

Company A is a private company limited by shares registered in ADGM. - Company A is 50% owned by Body Corporate 1 and 50% owned by Body Corporate 2. - Body Corporate 1 is 100% own by Individual 1. - Body Corporate 2 is own by: o Body Corporate 3 – 5%. o Body Corporate 4 – 25%. o Body corporate 5 – 70%.

Body Corporate 3 is 100% owned by Individual 2. - Body Corporate 4 is 100% owned by Individual 3. - Body Corporate 5 is 100% owned by Individual 4.

In this example, there are multiple individuals, companies, and indirect ownership. The percentage ownership (and calculation) for each individual is set out in the table below.

Individual Individual 1

Ownership in Company A. 50%

Calculation 100% * 50% = 50%

Individual 2 Individual 3 Individual 4

2.5% 12.5% 35% 100%

5% * 50% = 2.5% 25% * 50% = 12.5% 70% * 50% = 35%

Beneficial Owners: Individual 1 and Individual 4, being indirect owners of 50% and 35% of Company A respectively are the beneficial owners (the control test must also be applied however for additional beneficial owners).

Test 2 – The Control Test Even if a natural person is identified as the beneficial owner under test 1 above, any natural person who controls (in each case whether directly or indirectly) the ADGM company other than by positions held as officer of the ADGM company.

Note: Control means a natural person that:

holds, or may exercise, directly or indirectly, 25% or more of the voting rights in the company; or holds, or may exercise, the right, directly or indirectly, to appoint or remove a majority of the board of directors of the company.

Example 8:

In this example, - Company A is a private company limited by shares registered in ADGM. - Company A is own by:

o o

Individual 1 – 20% (ordinary shares) Individual 2 – 20% (ordinary shares)

o o o

Individual 3 – 20% (ordinary shares) Individual 4 – 20% (ordinary shares) Individual 5 – 20% (Class A shares)

-

Each of Ordinary shares has one voting rights. Each of Class A shares has two voting rights.

For this example, the percentage ownership and percentage of voting rights (and calculation) for each individual is set out in the table below.

Individual

Individual 1 Individual 2 Individual 3 Individual 4 Individual 5

Ownership in Company A.

20% (ordinary shares) 20% (ordinary shares) 20% (ordinary shares) 20% (ordinary shares) 20% (Class A shares)

Calculation rights) 20% * 1 (vote) = 16.67% 20% * 1 (vote) = 16.67% 20% *
