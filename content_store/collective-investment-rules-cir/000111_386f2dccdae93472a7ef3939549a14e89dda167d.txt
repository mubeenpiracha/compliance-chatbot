Guidance

In considering whether to permit a Fund Manager to use the words “guaranteed” or “protected” as part of or in connection with the name of a Fund, Sub-Fund or class of Units in a Fund, the DFSA will also take into account whether the degree of security implied by the name fairly reflects the nature of the arrangements for providing that security.
