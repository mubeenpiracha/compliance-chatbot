MANAGEMENT AND OPERATION OF A FUND

Guidance

While most of the provisions in this chapter are of general application to all Domestic Funds, in a few instances, some provisions which are specific to a certain type of Domestic Fund, for example a Public Fund, are retained in this Part. The DFSA has, instead of removing such provisions to Part 5 which contains provisions applicable to specific types of Domestic Funds, retained them in this Part because those requirements are integral to the main provisions applying to all Domestic Funds and therefore need to be read together.
