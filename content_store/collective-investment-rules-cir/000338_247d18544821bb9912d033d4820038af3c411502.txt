6.

An ETF differs from other Funds because unlike other exchange traded Funds, ETF Units have concurrent primary market and secondary market trading, primary market trading occurring in ‘creation Units’ between the Fund Manager and its Authorised Participant (AP), and secondary market trading between the AP and investors. See also Guidance under Rule 3.1.12.

7.

Investors in an ETF may incur additional costs and fees as they have to buy and sell ETF Units through an Authorised Participant (who directly buys and sells ‘creation units’ in the ETF from the ETF Fund Manager). These are different to the Units of the ETF which are traded on the relevant exchange, and are generally of a larger denomination than the Units available to investors on the relevant exchange.
