Related Party Transactions

Guidance

1. A Fund Manager of a Public Property Fund is required pursuant to Rule 8.3.2 to obtain the agreement of Unitholders by way of an ordinary resolution before undertaking a Related Party Transaction where the total consideration or value of the transaction is 5% or more of the net asset value of the Fund. See also App2 and App3.

2. A Fund Manager of a Public Property Fund may enter into a Related Party Transaction for the acquisition or sale of Real Property in the State without obtaining specific approval for the transaction under Rule 8.3.2 if all of the conditions in Rule 13.4.11A(1) are met.

3.

If a Fund Manager enters into a Related Party Transaction under the exclusion in Rule 13.4.11A, it must notify Unitholders of details of the transaction as soon as practicable after entering into the transaction. It also must disclose in the Fundâ€™s Prospectus if it has Unitholder approval to enter into such transactions without obtaining a resolution in each case (see Rule 14.4.4B).
