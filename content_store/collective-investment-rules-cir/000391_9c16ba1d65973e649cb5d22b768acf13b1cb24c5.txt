Guidance

1.

Under Article 50(3)(a) of the Law, an Information Memorandum of an Exempt Fund or a Qualified Investor Fund is a Prospectus for the purposes of the Law and the Rules unless otherwise provided. In limited circumstances, the Rules prescribe additional disclosure to be included in a Prospectus of an Exempt Fund (for example Rule 13.6.3 where an Exempt Fund appoints a prime broker with certain additional powers).

2.

There is no detailed prescribed disclosure content for the Information Memorandum of an Exempt Fund or a Qualified Investor Fund. However, as an Information Memorandum is a Prospectus, it is subject to the disclosure obligation in Article 52(2) of the Law. As a result, a Fund Manager of such a Fund must include all the information which Professional Clients to whom it intends to Offer Units of the Fund would reasonably require and expect to find in such a Prospectus. This is to enable such Clients to make an informed decision relating to investing in the Fund.
