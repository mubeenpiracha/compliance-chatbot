Guidance

The nature and extent of the systems and controls will depend upon a variety of factors including the nature, size and complexity of the Fund’s operations. While all Fund Managers and appointees, irrespective of size, legal structure or organisation need to comply with this section, the DFSA will take into account these factors and the differences that exist between Funds when assessing the adequacy of a Fund Manager’s systems and controls. Nevertheless, neither these factors nor the differences relieve a Fund Manager or appointees from compliance with their regulatory obligations.

(1)

The Persons appointed to perform the oversight function must report to the Fund Manager as to whether the Fund Manager’s systems and controls relating to the oversight function are operating as intended and remain adequate at least quarterly at a board meeting of the Fund Manager.

(2) Where an Eligible Custodian or Trustee has been appointed as the Person providing the oversight function, the Fund Manager must provide to that Person, and to the Fund’s Governing Body, a copy of the Fund’s most recent internal audit report and any compliance report as soon as such report is available to the Fund Manager.

Oversight report
