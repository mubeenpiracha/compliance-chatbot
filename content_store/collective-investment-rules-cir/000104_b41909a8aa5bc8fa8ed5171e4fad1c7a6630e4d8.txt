Guidance

1.

Under Rule 6A.1.4(b), a Fund Manager using a Fund Platform cannot establish on its Fund Platform any Funds other than a QIF if its authorisation is limited to managing QIFs. What type of Funds a Fund Manager can manage is reflected in the fees applicable to Fund Managers under FER.

2.

Rule 6A.1.4(c) does not prevent a Fund Manager from being able to share resources available to it (such as its IT systems and staff) between a Fund Platform and other Funds the Fund Manager manages on a stand-alone basis. However, a Fund Manager allocating its resources between the Fund Platform and such a Fund should be able to demonstrate (for example, through its written records) effective functional separation.
