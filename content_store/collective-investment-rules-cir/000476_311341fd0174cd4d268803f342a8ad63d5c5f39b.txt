The prohibition in (1) does not apply to the exercise of voting rights attaching to any Units which the Fund Manager or other member of the Governing Body of the Fund or its associate holds on behalf of, or jointly with, another Person who is not subject to the prohibition in (1) and from whom the Fund Manager or other member of the Governing Body of the Fund or its associate, as the case may be, has received voting instructions.

(3)

Therefore, for the purpose of Rule, Units held, or treated as held, by any Fund Manager or other member of the Governing Body of the Fund, must not, except as mentioned in (2), be regarded as being in issue.

If a resolution is required under these Rules for the approval of a Related Party Transaction, a Unitholder who is the Related Party proposing to enter into the transaction, and a Unitholder who is an Associate of that Related Party, is not entitled to vote on the resolution.
