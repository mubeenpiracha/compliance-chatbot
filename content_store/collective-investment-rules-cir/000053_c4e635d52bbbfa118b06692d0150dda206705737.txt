Article 50(1) of the Law contains the prohibition against the Offer of Units of Foreign Funds (i.e. marketing of Units of Foreign Funds) in or from the DIFC. Article 54(1) of the Law provides the limited circumstances in which an Authorised Firm may market Units of a Foreign Fund. An Authorised Firm may, under Article 54(1)(a), (b) or (c) of the Law, offer Units of a Foreign Fund if the conditions of the relevant paragraph are met. For example, under Article 54(1)(c), the offer is required to be by private placement to Professional Clients who invest at least US$ 50,000. Such marketing activities are also subject to additional requirements that are prescribed in this module â€“ see chapter 15. An Authorised Firm marketing Units of a Foreign Fund should take reasonable steps to ensure that the Fund meets the applicable requirements including the relevant criteria for being a specialist class of Fund.
