An Authorised Firm may, under Article 54(1)(a), (b) or (c) of the Law, offer Units of a Foreign Fund if the conditions of the relevant paragraph are met. For example, under Article 54(1)(c), the offer is required to be by private placement to Professional Clients who invest at least US$ 50,000. Such marketing
