Overview

1.

The DIFC Incorporated Cell Company (ICC) Regulations (‘the ICC Regulations’) provide for the establishment of an Incorporated Cell Company and its Incorporated Cells. The Incorporated Cells are stand-alone companies distinct from each other and from the ICC itself, of which they are cells. The ICC Regulations permit such companies to be used to conduct Fund business or Insurance Business.

2.

The ICC contains the infrastructure (e.g. systems and controls) for the exclusive use by the Fund Manager to manage Funds established as Incorporated Cells of the ICC. The ICC is the ‘core’ and each Incorporated Cell of the ICC is a Fund on the ICC. Under the ICC

Regulations, an ICC cannot itself be constituted as a Fund or act as a Fund Manager.
