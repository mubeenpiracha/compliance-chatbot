PART 2: DEFINITIONAL PROVISIONS

Guidance

A Collective Investment Fund is defined in Article 11 of the Law. The definition under Article 11 is very wide, however, Article 12 enables the DFSA to make Rules excluding certain arrangements or types of arrangements from constituting a Fund. These excluded arrangements are set out below in section 2.1.
