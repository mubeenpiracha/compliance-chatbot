Incorrect pricing

26.

The Fund Manager should record each instance where the Unit price is incorrect and, as soon as the error is discovered, report the fact to the Persons providing oversight functions together with details of the action taken, or to be taken, to avoid repetition.

27.

The Fund Manager and the Persons providing the oversight function should if they become aware, report material instances of incorrect pricing to the DFSA as provided in the Rules. Materiality should be determined by taking into account a number of factors, including whether the Fund Manager has followed the pricing controls set out in this guidance.

28.

The significance of any breakdown in management controls or other checking procedures should also be taken into account. The significance of any failure of systems should be considered. This may include situations where inadequate back-up arrangements exist. The duration of an error should also be taken into account; the longer an error persists, the more likely that it will have a material effect on a price.
