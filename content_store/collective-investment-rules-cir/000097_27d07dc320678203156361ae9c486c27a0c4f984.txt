Winding up of Domestic Funds

Guidance

Part 8 of the Law sets out all the provisions relating to transfer schemes and the winding up of Funds. Article 61(c) enables the DFSA to prescribe additional circumstances to those contained in the Law in relation to when a Fund may be wound up. This section contains such Rules.

Application

This Chapter applies to a Fund Manager and, where appointed, the Trustee of a Domestic Fund and, if the Fund is an Umbrella Fund using the form of a Protected Cell Company, in respect of each cell as though each cell is a separate Fund.

Guidance

Additional requirements in the ICC Regulations apply to the winding up of a Fund that is an Incorporated Cell of an Incorporated Cell Company (ICC). In particular, the ICC Regulations provide that an ICC shall not be wound up until after all of its Incorporated Cells are either transferred or converted into another Company or wound up.

Pursuant to Article 61(c) of the Law, the DFSA prescribes in this chapter the additional circumstances in which a Domestic Fund may be wound up.

Upon the happening of any of the events specified in (2
