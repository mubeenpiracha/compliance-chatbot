Under Article 26(1) of the Law, an Exempt Fund is required to have one of the permitted forms, i.e. an Investment Company, Investment Partnership or an Investment Trust. However, certain types of Exempt Funds which belong to a specialist class of Funds may be permitted to use only some and not all the permitted forms. See Part 6 for those variations.

If an Exempt Fund can no longer meet the relevant conditions to be classified as an Exempt Fund, the Fund Manager of that Fund is required, under Article 34(3), to apply for the winding up of that Fund. Alternatively, the Fund Manager may have that Fund moved to the classification of a Public Fund, which requires the satisfaction of the requirements and formalities specific to that type of Fund. An Exempt Fund may also, if it wishes to, convert to a Qualified Investor Fund provided it meets the conditions applicable to a Qualified Investor Fund in Article 16(5) of the Law.
