and the role of Fund Administrators and Custodians and where appointed, prime brokers.

Guidance

A prime broker is a Person who provides to a Fund a range of services including custody and depository services, trading and execution services, clearing and settlement services and financing to support the Fund’s investment activities. Such financing activities generally include stock lending and borrowing. The restrictions in Rules A1.3.1(c) and (f) of Appendix 1 (App 1) prevent a Fund Manager of a Hedge Fund from authorising a prime broker to commingle the assets of the Fund with any other assets held by or available to the prime broker and use those assets as collateral to support the prime broker’s cross lending and borrowing activities involving Funds to which it acts as the prime broker. However, the restrictions in A1.3.2(c) and (f) do not apply if a Fund Manager of a Hedge Fund can comply with the requirements relating to the use of prime brokers set out in Rule 13.6.3.

(1)

The Fund Manager of a Hedge Fund must ensure functional separation and independence between:

(a)

the functions of Fund valuation and asset pricing; and

(b)

the investment management process.

(2) Where the Fund manager is unable to demonstrate adequate separation and independence in accordance with (1), the DFSA may require the Fund Manager to appoint an independent, suitably competent and experienced Fund Administrator to perform the functions specified in (1)(a).

Guidance

To provide segregation of the net asset value determination process of the Fund from the investment management process, generally personnel involved in the former should not be involved in the latter. An effective method of achieving such segregation is to delegate the calculation, determination and production of the net asset value to a suitably competent and experienced third party Fund Administrator.

Use of prime brokers

A Fund Manager of a Hedge Fund may only grant to a prime broker authority to combine the assets of the Fund with any other assets held by or available to the prime broker as collateral for any financing activities to be undertaken by the prime broker where, and so long as, all the following conditions are met:

(a)

the Fund is an Exempt Fund or Qualified Investor Fund;

(b)

the Prospectus of the Fund contains, in addition to the disclosure required under chapter 14, the following mandatory disclosure and warnings:

(i)

the identity and profile of the prime broker, including where it is located and how it is regulated;

(ii)

the services which the prime broker provides to the Fund and the nature and extent to which the prime broker has the power and

COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT RULES (CIR)

authority to combine the assets of the Fund with any other assets held by or available to the prime broker as collateral for any financing activities undertaken by the prime broker; and

(iii) a prominent health warning in the Prospectus to alert prospective

Unitholders to the facts that:

(A)

the Fund’s appointed prime broker has the power and authority to use as collateral the assets of the Fund in conjunction with any other assets held by or available to the prime broker; and

(B) where the prime broker uses Fund assets as collateral pursuant to the above power, the Unitholders may lose all the assets of the Fund in the event of the insolvency of the prime broker;

(c)

the Person appointed as the prime broker qualifies as an Eligible Custodian;

(d)

the agreement between the prime broker and the Fund Manager contains mandatory contractual provisions that:

(i)

prohibit the prime broker from using as collateral the assets of the Fund to an extent exceeding 140% of the Fund’s indebtedness to the prime broker at any given time; and

(ii)

create an irrevocable right in favour of the Fund that enables any indebtedness of the Fund to the prime broker to be set off against any amounts that are owing by the prime broker to the Fund, including in the event of the insolvency of the prime broker; and

(e)

the Fund Manager has in place adequate valuation procedures to mark positions to market daily in order to meet
