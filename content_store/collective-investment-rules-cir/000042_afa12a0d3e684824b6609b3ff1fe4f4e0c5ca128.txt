COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT RULES (CIR)

PART 5: RULES SPECIFIC TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF DOMESTIC FUNDS

Guidance

Article 13 of the Law defines Funds as either Domestic Funds or Foreign Funds. Article 15 of the Law further defines Domestic Funds as falling into three categories, i.e. Public Funds, Exempt Funds and Qualified Investor Funds. While the core requirements in Part 4 of this module are of common application to most types of Domestic Funds, the requirements in this Part apply only to certain types of Domestic Funds, depending on whether they are Public Funds, Exempt Funds or Qualified Investor Funds. Where a certain type of Fund is also a specialist class of Funds, there are additional requirements that are prescribed in Part 6.
