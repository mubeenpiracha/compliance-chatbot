Where a Fund invests in infrastructure projects (for example, the development of public facilities such as roads, railways or bridges), the Fund Manager may hold self-custody of the Fund Property which consists of the interest in the infrastructure project. However, where it does so, the Fund Manager is not exempt from the overarching obligation under CIR 8.2.2(1) to Unitholders of the QIF to ensure safe custody of the Fund Property. This envisages proper identification and segregation of the interest in the infrastructure project as Fund Property of the QIF.
