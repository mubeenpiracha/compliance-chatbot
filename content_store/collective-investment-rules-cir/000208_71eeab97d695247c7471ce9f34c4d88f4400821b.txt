Under Rule 8.2.2(2), the Fund Manager of an Investment Company or Investment Partnership must delegate the function of holding safe custody of Fund Property (i.e. the Financial Service of Providing Custody in relation to Fund Property) to an Eligible Custodian. In the case of an Investment Trust, the Trustee of the Fund provides the safe custody function relating to Fund Property. However, this obligation does not apply in the case of certain types of specialist Funds where alternative safe custody arrangements are permitted (see the custody requirements for Private Equity Funds and certain types of Property Funds in Rules 13.3.1, 13.4.2, 13.4.2A and 13.4.2B).
