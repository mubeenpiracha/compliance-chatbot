Guidance

1.

If a Fund Manager of an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) has an arrangement with a Related Party, for that Related Party to provide an index or benchmark, then the Fund Manager is required to also treat that arrangement as a Related Party Transaction (see Rule 13.9.5) and comply with Rule 8.3.2 in relation to the transaction.

2.

An ETF Fund Manager is not required to comply with the requirements in Rule 8.3.2(3) and (4) in relation to a Price Information Provider (PIP), who is a Related Party and provides a custom made index or other benchmark which the ETF tracks, if that appointment takes place at the time of establishing the ETF. This is because, generally, there are no investors in the Fund at that time to give the prior approval that is envisaged.

3.

However, such an ETF Fund Manager does need to comply with the armâ€™s length transaction requirement in Rule 8.3.2(2) and, also, disclose in the Fund Prospectus that it tracks a custom made index, or other benchmark, provided by a Related Party PIP (under Rule 14.4.8(d)).
