(b)

take reasonable steps to ensure the risk diversification limit is achieved within the specified period referred to in (a);

(c)

if it is unable to achieve the risk diversification limit within the specified period referred to in (a), then within 30 days from the end of that period, seek Unitholder approval to amend its strategy or to extend the period for achieving its strategy;

(d)

if Unitholder approval is obtained under (c), take reasonable steps to ensure the risk diversification limit is achieved within the extended period which must not exceed four years from the date the Fund is established; and

(e)

once the risk diversification limit is achieved under (b) or (d) take reasonable steps to ensure it is not breached.

to the extent that there is unencumbered cash or liquid assets available for redemption or distribution purposes;
