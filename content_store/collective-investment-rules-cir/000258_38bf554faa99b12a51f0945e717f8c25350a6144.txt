1.

Article 27(1)(e) of the Law requires a Domestic Fund that is not an Investment Trust to have legal title to the Fund Property registered with an eligible person (unless the Rules provide otherwise). Rule 12A.3.1(1) specifies that the person must be an Eligible Custodian. Rule 12A.3.1(2) disapplies the requirement in relation to Fund Property of certain kinds of Qualified Investor Funds. Regardless of who holds title to Fund Property, the Fund Manager must always ensure that, in accordance with Article 22(2)(f) of the Law, Fund Property is clearly identified as such and held separately from property of the Fund Manager and any other Funds. Where Fund Property consists of cash or liquid assets, the assets must also be held under arrangements that clearly identify them as belonging to the Fund, and must be properly segregated from similar assets belonging to the Fund Manager and any other Funds.
