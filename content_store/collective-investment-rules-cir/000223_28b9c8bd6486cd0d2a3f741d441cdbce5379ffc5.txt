Guidance

1.

The principles do not apply to an individual in respect of any other functions he may carry out, although his conduct in those functions may be relevant to his fitness and propriety.

2.

Breaching a principle makes an individual liable to disciplinary action and may indicate that he is no longer fit and proper to perform an oversight function and the DFSA may consider exercising its power under Article 39(2) of the Law to object to the appointment and require the Fund Manager to appoint a replacement.

3.

The onus will be on the DFSA to show that he is culpable, taking into account the standard of conduct required under the principle in question. In determining whether or not the particular conduct of an individual complies with the principles, the DFSA will take into account whether that conduct is consistent with the requirements and standards relevant to an individualâ€™s role and the information available to him.
