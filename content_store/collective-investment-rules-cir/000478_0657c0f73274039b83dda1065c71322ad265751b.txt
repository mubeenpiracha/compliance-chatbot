changes the purpose or nature of the Fund;

(b)

may materially prejudice a Unitholder;

(c)

alters the risk profile of the Fund; or

(d)

introduces any new type of payment out of Fund Property.

(3)

Notwithstanding (2) above, any change may be fundamental depending on its degree of materiality and effect on the Fund and its Unitholders. Consequently, the Fund Manager must determine whether in each case a particular change is fundamental in nature and, if the Fund is an Investment Trust, obtain the Trustee’s agreement to the outcome of the determination.
