in response to a request made to the DFSA by the Trustee, Fund Manager or other member of its Governing Body for the removal of a Fund from the list of registered Funds, the DFSA has agreed, albeit subject to there being no material change in any relevant factor, that, on the conclusion of the winding up of the Fund, the DFSA will accede to that request;

(b)

the expiration of any period specified in the Constitution as the period at the end of which the Fund is to terminate; or

(c)

the effective date of a duly approved transfer scheme, which is to result in the Fund that is subject to the transfer scheme being left with no property.
