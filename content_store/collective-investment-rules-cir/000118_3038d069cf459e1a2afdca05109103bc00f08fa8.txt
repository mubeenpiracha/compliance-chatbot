Guidance

1.

The Companies Regulations permit Investment Companies to have a sole corporate director. An Investment Company has the option to be internally managed, by having that corporate director act as its Fund Manager. Alternatively, an Investment Company has the option to have an ‘external’ Fund Manager. In both cases, the Fund Manager must be licensed and is legally accountable to Unitholders in the Fund (i.e., to its shareholders) for the proper management of the Fund (i.e. the Fund Property).

2.

A Corporate Director of an Investment Company, which elects to be internally managed, is required to meet all the other requirements that are applicable to an applicant for a Fund Manager’s Licence, including the capital requirements (in PIB), and the adequate systems and controls requirements (in GEN). However, as such a Corporate Director can only act as the Fund Manager of the Investment Company (and not of any other Funds), the systems and controls requirements would apply proportionately to the nature and scale of the activities of that company.
