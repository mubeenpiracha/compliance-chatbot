COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT RULES (CIR)

Rule 12A.3.1(2)(c) provides that this requirement does not apply to a Qualified Investor Fund that is a Venture Capital Fund. Rule 13.10.2 makes similar provision for the requirement not to apply where a Venture Capital Fund is an Exempt Fund.

2. Where a Fund Manager of a Venture Capital Fund holds Fund Property of any type, whether investments, cash or other liquid assets, the Fund Manager must ensure that the property is clearly identifiable as Fund Property and is properly segregated from all other assets belonging to, or managed by, the Fund Manager, so it is not available to creditors in the event of the insolvency of the Fund Manager.
