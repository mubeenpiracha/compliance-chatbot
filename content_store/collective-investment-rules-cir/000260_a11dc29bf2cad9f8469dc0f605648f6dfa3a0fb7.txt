PART 6: RULES SPECIFIC TO SPECIALIST CLASSES OF DOMESTIC

FUNDS

Guidance

1.

Article 17 of the Law confers on the DFSA the power to prescribe any type of Domestic Fund (i.e. a Public Fund, an Exempt Fund, or a Qualified Investor Fund) as a “specialist class” of a Domestic Fund and in so doing apply any requirements as are suitable for that specialist class of Funds. This Part sets out the requirements that apply to such a Fund by virtue of being a specialist class of Fund.

2.

Most of the requirements that are set out in this part as applying to specialist classes of Domestic Funds are generally in addition to the core requirements that apply to every Domestic Fund (see Part 4). Further, depending on whether it is a Public Fund, an Exempt Fund or a Qualified Investor Fund, the additional requirements in Part 5 of this module would also apply to a specialist class of Fund.
