A Venture Capital Fund may also invest in a business venture using tokens that give the Fund rights attaching or analogous to holding Shares or Units, i.e. equity participation rights in the profits and assets of the venture, with or without governance rights. However, a right to receive utility tokens or payment tokens issued by a business venture, for example, operating in the distributed ledger or similar technology sector, which does note provide such rights, will not be an equity participation right referred to in Rule 3.1.13(b). The DFSA may consider, on a case-by-case basis, any new arrangements relating to tokens as a means of investing in a venture operating in distributed ledger or similar technology sector, to assess whether those tokens meet the criteria in Rule 3.1.13(b).
