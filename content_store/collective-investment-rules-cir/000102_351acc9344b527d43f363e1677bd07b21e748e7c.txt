Application of chapter

This chapter applies to a Fund Manager that uses a Fund Platform.

General application of CIR to Incorporated Cell Companies

Except as otherwise provided in these Rules, the requirements in CIR that apply:

(a)

to a Fund Manager, apply to a Fund Manager when it uses an Incorporated Cell Company (ICC) to provide infrastructure to a Fund; and

(b)

in relation to a Fund that is a Company, apply in relation to a Fund that is an Incorporated Cell of an ICC.

Guidance

Because each Fund (i.e. an Incorporated Cell) is a stand-alone Fund, the Fund Manager using a Fund Platform needs to comply with all the applicable requirements in respect of each such Fund, although it is a Fund on a Fund Platform.
