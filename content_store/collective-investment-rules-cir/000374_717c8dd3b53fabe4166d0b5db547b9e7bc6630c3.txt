a.

any offer document prepared for the purposes of complying with the requirements applicable in the jurisdiction in which the External Fund is established is regarded as a Prospectus for the purposes of the requirements relating to the Offer of Units of such a Fund in or from the DIFC (see Article 50(3)(c) of the Law); and

b.

the DFSA has the power to prescribe any additional disclosure to be included in such a document (see Article 51(2) of the Law).

Those requirements are specified in Rules 14.2.4 â€“ 14.2.7.

5.

If a Domestic Fund is a Passported Fund and the DIFC is the Home Jurisdiction of the Fund, certain requirements relating to the Prospectus for the Fund are specified in the Fund Protocol Rules (FPR), rather than in this chapter. These include requirements relating to the form of the disclaimer in the Prospectus, the minimum contents of the Prospectus and the need for a Key Investor Information Document (KIID) that summarises the key features of the Fund and is in both Arabic and English. This chapter cross-refers to requirements in those Rules where applicable.
