Guidance

1.

A Fund Manager of a Public Property Fund may itself act as custodian of Real Property if it has in place adequate systems and controls to ensure the segregation and protection of the Real Property. This option only applies for Real Property (defined as land or buildings, whether freehold or leasehold, where the unexpired term of any lease exceeds 20 years). It does not permit the Fund Manager to act as custodian of Property Related Assets such as Shares in a Body Corporate which invests in Real Property or Units in another Property Fund.

2.

In identifying, managing and monitoring conflicts of interest that may arise due to it acting as custodian, the Fund Manager must take into account that it is required under the Law to give priority to Unitholders’ interests if there is a conflict between its own interests and the interests of Unitholders.

3.

If a Fund Manager decides to act as custodian of Real Property as permitted under this Rule, it must disclose in the Fund’s Prospectus that it acts as custodian, the additional risks that may arise due to it acting as custodian, and how it has addressed those risks (see Rule 14.4.4A).
