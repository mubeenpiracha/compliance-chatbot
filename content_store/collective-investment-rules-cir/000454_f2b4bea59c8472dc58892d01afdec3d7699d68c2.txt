Winding up of Domestic Funds

Guidance

Part 8 of the Law sets out all the provisions relating to transfer schemes and the winding up of Funds. Article 61(c) enables the DFSA to prescribe additional circumstances to those contained in the Law in relation to when a Fund may be wound up. This section contains such Rules.

Application

This Chapter applies to a Fund Manager and, where appointed, the Trustee of a Domestic Fund and, if the Fund is an Umbrella Fund using the form of a Protected Cell Company, in respect of each cell as though each cell is a separate Fund.
