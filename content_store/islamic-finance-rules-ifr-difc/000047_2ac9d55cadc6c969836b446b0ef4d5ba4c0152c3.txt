Additional disclosure requirements for PSIAs

An Authorised Firm must, prior to Managing a PSIA, provide written notice to the Client that the Client alone will bear any losses arising from the PSIA, which are limited to the amount of his contribution, unless there is negligence, misconduct or breach of contract on the part of the Authorised Firm.
