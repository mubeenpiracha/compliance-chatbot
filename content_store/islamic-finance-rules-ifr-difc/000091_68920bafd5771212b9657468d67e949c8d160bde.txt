6.2.1(2), the Fund Manager should still consider whether the requirements in both Rule 3.5.1(1) and 6.2.1(1) are met in respect of that board.

If the Fund Manager is relying on Shari’a screening methodologies such as the Dow Jones Shari’a index, such screening is generally regarded as widely accepted and accessible. However, if less widely known methodologies are used, the Fund Manager should be able, upon request by the DFSA, to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the DFSA the grounds on which it considers the particular methodology used to be acceptable and reliable.
