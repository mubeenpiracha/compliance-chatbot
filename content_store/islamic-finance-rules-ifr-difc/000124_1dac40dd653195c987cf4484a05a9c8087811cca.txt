Guidance

1.

Firms conducting Insurance Business comprising Takaful must comply with the requirements in PIN. Takaful related prudential requirements are not included in this module because of the closely integrated nature of such requirements with the requirements that apply to conventional insurance.

2.

Note that structures of Takaful Insurers (including reinsurers) vary, as do the Islamic contracts governing their business. As the DFSA has not as yet thought it appropriate to limit the permissible structures and contracts, the DFSA is willing to consider modifications to its Rules to apply the most appropriate prudential regime to a Takaful entity. For many Takaful companies, this is likely to involve capital tests at the level of the Takaful participantsâ€™ fund or funds, and for the firm as a whole.
