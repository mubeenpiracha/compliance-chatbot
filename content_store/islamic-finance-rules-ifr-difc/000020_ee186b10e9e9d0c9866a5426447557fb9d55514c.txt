Persons conducting Takaful insurance are conducting Insurance Business. There are two types of Financial Services that comprise Insurance Business, ie, Effecting Contracts of Insurance or Carrying out Contracts of Insurance. Accordingly, any Person carrying on these Financial Services activities is subject to the DFSA regime for regulating Financial Services. Where such activities are carried out as Takaful insurance, there are additional Takaful specific requirements that apply to such an insurer, which are set out in this module (see IFR chapter 8). In addition, there are certain activities relating to insurance, such as advising and arranging, which are regulated as Insurance Intermediation (see GEN section 2.19). Persons conducting those activities in relation to Takaful insurance are regulated in the same way as Persons conducting such activities in relation to conventional insurance.
