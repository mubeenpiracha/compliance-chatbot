Requirements of a Scheme

An Application under section 86 in respect of a scheme shall be accompanied by a report on the terms of the Transfer Scheme (a "Scheme Report").

A Scheme Report may only be made by a personâ€”

(a)

who, in the Regulator's opinion, has the necessary skills to make a proper report; and

(b)

is nominated or approved by the Regulator.

A Scheme Report must be made in a form approved by the Regulator.

The Regulator may direct that a Scheme Report need not be provided, if for reasons of urgency, it is in the interests of the Abu Dhabi Global Market to do so.

The person concerned or the Fund concerned must provide written notice of the proposed transfer to all interested parties as determined by the Regulator at their last known mailing address.

The person concerned or the Fund concerned must publish a notice in a designated newsletter which it thinks would be most suitable for bringing the notice to the attention of those who would be affected by the proposed transfer.
