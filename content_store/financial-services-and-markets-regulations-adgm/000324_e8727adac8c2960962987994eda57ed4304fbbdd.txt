Indemnity for certain acts124

(1)

Where a Relevant Office-Holder takes any action in relation to property of a Defaulter which is liable to be dealt with in accordance with the Default Rules of a Recognised Body or Remote Body, and believes and has reasonable grounds for believing that he is entitled to take that action, he is not liable to any person in respect of any loss or damage resulting from his action except in so far as the loss or damage is caused by the Relevant Office- Holder's own negligence.

(2)

Any failure by a Recognised Body or Remote Body to comply with its own rules in respect of any matter shall not prevent that matter being treated for the purposes of this Part as done in accordance with those rules so long as the failure does not substantially affect the rights of any person entitled to require compliance with the rules.
