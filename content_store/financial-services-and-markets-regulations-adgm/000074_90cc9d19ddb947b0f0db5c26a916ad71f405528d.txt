If the Regulator—

(a)

imposes a requirement of the kind mentioned in subsection (3)(a); and

(b)

gives notice of the requirement to any institution with whom A keeps an account;

the notice has the effects mentioned in subsection (5).

(5)

Those effects are that—

(a)

the institution does not act in breach of any contract with A if, having been instructed by A (or on A's behalf) to transfer any sum or otherwise make any payment out of A's account, it refuses to do so in the reasonably held belief that complying with the instruction would be incompatible with the requirement; and

(b)

if the institution complies with such an instruction, it shall be liable to pay to the Regulator an amount equal to the amount transferred from, or otherwise paid out of, A's account in contravention of the requirement.

(6)

If the Regulator imposes a requirement of the kind mentioned in subsection (3)(b), assets held by a person as trustee in accordance with the requirement shall not, while the requirement is in force, be released or dealt with except with the consent of the Regulator.
