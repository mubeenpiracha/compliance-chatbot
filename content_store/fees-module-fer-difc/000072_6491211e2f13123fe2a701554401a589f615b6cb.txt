Guidance

1. Where a Bidder issues a revised Bid Document that increases the value of the Bid, the DFSA will require payment of the difference between the fee that would be applicable under the table in Rule 5.1.1 (4) in respect of the value of the revised Bid, and the fee previously paid in respect of the value of the initial Bid.
