The Regulator will, when considering the treatment of Islamic Financial Business arrangements, take a "substance over form" approach giving particular weight to the economic substance of a particular activity over the legal and/or Shari'a form taken by it.

(vii)

The issue of financial products which are securities such as shares, bonds (falling under paragraphs 88 or 90 of Schedule 1 to FSMR), Sukuk or units in a Collective Investment Fund (in each case as defined in FSMR) attracts product-specific disclosure requirements such as the publication of a Prospectus or an Exempt Disclosure Statement. Where such securities are included on an Official List of securities or made available to the public in ADGM, there are initial and ongoing disclosure and other obligations that apply to the Reporting Entity (generally the issuer) under the MKT Rulebook. These MKT obligations are distinct from the obligations that apply to Persons carrying on Regulated Activities in respect of such Securities.
