Profit Sharing Investment Accounts (PSIAs)

(viii)

PSIAs do not fall within the definitions of Dealing in Investments, Arranging Deals in Investments or Advising on Investments or Credit in Schedule 1 to FSMR or the definition of Investments in the Glossary (“GLO”). They are contractual arrangements under which Islamic banks invest clients' funds, often (though not always) on a pooled basis, and are generally treated by the bank as off balance sheet. They are generally structured under the Shari'a principle of Mudaraba, the guiding principle of which is that the investor bears the full investment risk. Although PSIAs have the characteristics of a Collective Investment Fund, under an express exclusion provided under paragraph 63 of Schedule 1 to FSMR, they are not treated as such. Instead, Managing a PSIA is a distinct Regulated Activity as defined in paragraph 64 of Schedule 1 to FSMR.
