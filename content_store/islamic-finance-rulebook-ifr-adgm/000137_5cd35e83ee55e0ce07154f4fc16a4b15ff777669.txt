Guidance

1.

Remedial action may not require the disposal of Fund assets to pays off part of the borrowings where such disposal would be prejudicial to the interest of Unitholders.

2.

As there are no specific risks that arise by virtue of a Fund being an Islamic Fund, the prudential requirements that apply to a Category 3 firm as set out in the PRU Rulebook apply to such Fund Managers. However, if the underlying assets of the Fund are invested in financial products or instruments that are Islamic and have certain features which would raise any prudential risks, it is the responsibility of the Fund Manager to address such risks. The Regulator would provide any additional clarifications regarding such matters upon request.
