(ii)

When an Authorised Person Offers Islamic Securities in ADGM, IFR 7 applies irrespective of whether such Authorised Person is an Islamic Financial Institution, acts through an Islamic Window or is a conventional institution. A conventional institution may be held to offer Islamic Securities where it acts as the underwriter of an issuance of Sukuk or where it elects to act as the obligor under a Sukuk issuance.

(iii)

The issue of Securities is not an activity that constitutes a Regulated Activity. Therefore, activities such as the issue of Shares, Debentures (Sukuk) or Warrants do not attract the Regulated Activity prohibitions in FSMR. The Offer of Securities, however, is an activity to which FSMR and the MKT Rulebook apply. Under FSMR, a Person making an Offer of Securities in ADGM is subject to numerous disclosure requirements, unless exempt.
