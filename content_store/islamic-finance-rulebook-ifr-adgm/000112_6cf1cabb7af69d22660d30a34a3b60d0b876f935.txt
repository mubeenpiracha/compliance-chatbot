no member of the Shari'a Supervisory Board is a director or Controller of the Fund or its Fund Manager.

(b)

A Fund Manager may comply with the requirement in IFR 6.2.1(a) by appointing to the Fund the same Shari'a Supervisory Board as it has appointed to itself as an Authorised Person (and whether acting as an Islamic Financial Institution or through an Islamic Window) in accordance with IFR 3.5.2, provided the requirements in IFR (a) are also met.

(c)

A Fund Manager is not required to comply with the requirement in IFR 6.2.1(a) where it relies, for the purposes of making investments for the Fund, on a widely accepted Shari'a screening process such as investing in securities included in, or recognised by reference to, an Islamic index, sukuk, or treasury instruments issued by a Shari'a-compliant financial services provider regulated by an international recognised and reputable financial services regulator.
