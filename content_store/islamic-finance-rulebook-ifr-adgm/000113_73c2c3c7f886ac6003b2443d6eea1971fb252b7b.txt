Guidance

(i)

In appointing a Shari'a Supervisory Board for the purposes of 6.2.1(a), the Fund Manager should consider the previous experience and qualifications of the proposed Shari'a Supervisory Board members to assess whether the proposed Shari'a Supervisory Board member is competent to advise on the activities undertaken by the Islamic Fund. If the Fund Manager is appointing the same Shari'a Supervisory Board as it has appointed to the firm pursuant to (b), the Fund Manager should still consider whether the requirements in both (a) and IFR 3.5.2(a) are met in respect of that board.
