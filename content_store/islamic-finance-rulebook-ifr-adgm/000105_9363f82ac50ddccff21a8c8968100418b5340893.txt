Guidance

(i)

The Fund Rules contains the key requirements relating to the management and operation of conventional Collective Investment Funds. These Islamic Finance Rules set out the additional requirements that apply where such a Fund is managed or held out as being managed as an Islamic Fund. There are other requirements that apply to Authorised Persons managing Islamic Funds which are found in the Rulebooks, such as the GEN Rulebook, COBS Rulebook and PRU Rulebook.

(ii)

While IFR 3 contains the requirements that apply to Authorised Persons which are Fund Managers of Collective Investment Funds, the requirements in this IFR 6 mainly focus on Shari'a compliance related requirements that apply at the Fund level. For example, while the systems and controls required under IFR 3.3 relate to the systems and controls that a firm must have in order to comply with its Shari'a obligations, IFR 6.1.3 sets out systems and controls that must be established and maintained at the Fund level.
