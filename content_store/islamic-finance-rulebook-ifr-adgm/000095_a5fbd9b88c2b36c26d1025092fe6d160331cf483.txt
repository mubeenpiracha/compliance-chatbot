(xii) Where Mudaraba and Musharaka contracts are used to invest in commercial enterprise to undertake business ventures other than trading activities (or other than those which meet the requirements for inclusion in the Trading Book), the E is measured as the amount invested in the commercial enterprise less any specific provisions. If there is a guarantee and such guarantor is not connected to the commercial enterprise, then the CRW for the guarantor will be applied for risk weighting for the amount of any such guarantee.
