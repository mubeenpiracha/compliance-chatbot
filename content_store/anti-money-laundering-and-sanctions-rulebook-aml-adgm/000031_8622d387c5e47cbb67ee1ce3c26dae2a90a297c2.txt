Guidance on the term "customer"

1.

The point at which a Person becomes a customer will vary from business to business. However, the Regulator considers that it would usually occur at or prior to the business relationship being formalised, for example, by the signing of a client agreement or the acceptance by the customer of terms of business.

2.

The Regulator does not consider that a Person would be a customer of a Relevant Person merely because such Person receives marketing information from a Relevant Person or where a Relevant Person refers a Person who is not a customer to a third party, including a Group member.

3.

The Regulator considers that a Counterparty would generally be a customer for the purposes of the AML Rulebook and would therefore require a Relevant Person to undertake CDD on such a Person. However, this would not include a counterparty in a Transaction undertaken on a Regulated Exchange. Nor would it include suppliers of ancillary business services for consumption by the Relevant Person such as cleaning, catering, stationery, IT or other similar services.
