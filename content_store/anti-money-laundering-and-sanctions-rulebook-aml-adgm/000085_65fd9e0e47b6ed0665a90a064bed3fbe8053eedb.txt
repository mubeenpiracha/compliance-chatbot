Guidance

1.

Unless a Relevant Person understands the money laundering risks to which it is exposed, it cannot take appropriate steps to prevent its business from being used for the purposes of money laundering. Money laundering risks vary from business to business depending on the nature of the business, the type of customers a business has, the nature of the products and services sold, and the geographical operations in which it operates.

2.

Using the RBA, a Relevant Person should assess its own vulnerabilities to money laundering and take all reasonable steps to eliminate or manage such risks. The results of this assessment will also feed into the Relevant Person's risk assessment of its customers under Chapter 7.

3.

In addition to assessing risk arising from money laundering, a business risk assessment should assess the potential exposure of a Relevant Person to other Financial Crime, such as fraud and the theft of personal data. The business risk assessment should also address the Relevant Person’s potential exposure to cyber security risk, as this risk may have a material impact on the Relevant Person’s ability to prevent Financial Crime.
