DNFBP REGISTRATION AND SUPERVISION

Guidance

1.

FSMR gives the Regulator the power to supervise DNFBPs’ compliance with relevant Federal AML Legislation. FSMR also gives the Regulator a number of other powers in relation to DNFBPs, including powers of enforcement. This includes the power to obtain information and to conduct investigations into possible breaches of FSMR. The Regulator may also impose fines for breaches of FSMR or the Rules. It may also suspend or withdraw the registration of a DNFBP in various circumstances.

2.

The Regulator takes a risk-based approach to regulation of persons which it supervises. Generally, the Regulator will work with DNFBPs to identify, assess, mitigate and control relevant risks where appropriate. The Guidance & Policies Manual (“GPM”) describes the Regulator’s enforcement powers under FSMR and outlines its policy for using these powers.

3.

Rule 15.1.1 requires a DNFBP to be registered by the Regulator to conduct its activities in ADGM. Rule 15.2.1 sets out the criteria a DNFBP must meet to be registered. The Regulator may suspend or withdraw the registration of a DNFBP where the DNFBP no longer meets the criteria for registration.
