CUSTOMER RISK ASSESSMENT

Guidance

1.

This Chapter prescribes the risk-based assessment that must be undertaken by a Relevant Person on a customer and the proposed business relationship, Transaction or product. The outcome of this process is to produce a risk rating for a customer, which determines the level of CDD that must be undertaken in relation to that customer under Chapter 8. Chapter 8 prescribes the requirements of CDD, Enhanced CDD for high-risk customers and, where appropriate, Simplified CDD for low-risk customers.

2.

CDD in the context of AML/TFS refers to the process of identifying a customer, verifying such identification and monitoring the customer's business and the potential for any money laundering risk on an ongoing basis. CDD is required to be completed following a risk-based assessment of the customer and the proposed business relationship, Transaction or product.

3.

Relevant Persons should note that the ongoing CDD requirements in Rule 8.6.1 require a Relevant Person to review a customer's risk rating to ensure that it remains appropriate in light of the potential money laundering risks.
