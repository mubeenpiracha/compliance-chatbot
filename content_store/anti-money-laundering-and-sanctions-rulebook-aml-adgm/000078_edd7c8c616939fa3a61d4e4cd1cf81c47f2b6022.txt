Guidance

1.

Rule 5.1.1 requires a Relevant Person to adopt an approach to AML/TFS which is proportionate to the risks. This is called the "risk-based approach" ("RBA"). The Regulator expects the RBA to be a key part of the Relevant Person's AML/TFS compliance culture and to cascade down from the Senior Management to the rest of the organisation. Embedding the RBA within its business allows a Relevant Person to make decisions and allocate AML/TFS resources in the most efficient and effective way.

2.

In implementing the RBA, a Relevant Person is expected to have in place processes to identify, assess, monitor, manage and mitigate money laundering risks. The general principle is that where there are higher risks of money laundering, a Relevant Person is required to take enhanced measures to manage and mitigate those risks. Correspondingly, when the risks are lower, simplified measures are permitted. Simplified measures are not permitted where there is a suspicion of money laundering.
