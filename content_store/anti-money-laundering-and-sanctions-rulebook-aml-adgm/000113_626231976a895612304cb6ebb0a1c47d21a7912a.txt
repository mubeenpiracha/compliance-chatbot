Guidance on Restricted Scope Companies

1.

A Restricted Scope Company is a corporate vehicle offering a greater degree of confidentiality than other forms of corporate entity in ADGM. Restricted Scope Companies are not required to file accounts and are not required to have their accounts audited. Restricted Scope Companies must file an annual return, articles, and details of their registered offices, directors and secretary (if they have one) with the ADGM Registrar of Companies.

2.

Relevant Persons will know that Restricted Scope Companies are subject to less onerous corporate disclosure requirements than other forms of corporate entities due to the requirement to have "(Restricted)" in a company's name. Given that only the constitution and details of the registered office of a Restricted Scope Company will be available in a public register, a Relevant Person will be required to have a bilateral dialogue with the Restricted Scope Company, in accordance with the RBA, to obtain any other relevant information which it needs to assess the money laundering risks to which it is exposed.
