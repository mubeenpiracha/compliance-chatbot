A Relevant Person should be proactive in checking for, and taking measures to comply with, relevant resolutions or Sanctions which the Relevant Person is required to comply with, under legislation applicable in ADGM or any other jurisdiction.

The Regulator expects Relevant Persons to perform checks on an ongoing basis against their customer databases and records for any names appearing in resolutions or Sanctions which the Relevant Person is required to comply with as well as to monitor transactions accordingly.
