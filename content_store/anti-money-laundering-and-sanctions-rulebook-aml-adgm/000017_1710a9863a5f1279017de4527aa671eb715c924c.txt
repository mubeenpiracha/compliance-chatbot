The AML Rulebook is not intended to be read in isolation from other UAE relevant legislation or developments in international policy and best practice. To the extent applicable, Relevant Persons need to be aware of, and take into account, how these may impact the Relevant Person's day-to-day operations. This is particularly relevant when considering the Local Terrorist List and the United Nations Security Council ("UNSC") Resolutions which apply in ADGM, and Sanctions imposed by other jurisdictions which may apply to a Relevant Person depending on the Relevant Person's jurisdiction of origin, its business and/or customer base.
