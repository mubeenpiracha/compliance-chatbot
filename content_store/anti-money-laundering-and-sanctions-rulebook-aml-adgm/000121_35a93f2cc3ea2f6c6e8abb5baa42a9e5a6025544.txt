Guidance

1.

A Relevant Person should undertake appropriate CDD in a manner proportionate to the customer's money laundering risks. This means that all customers are subject to CDD under Rule 8.3.1. However, for high-risk customers, additional Enhanced Customer Due Diligence measures should also be undertaken under Rule 8.4.1. For customers having a low-risk rating, the requirements under Rule

AML VER10.020125

8.3.1 may be modified according to the assessed risk, in accordance with Rule 8.5.1.

2.

The frequency for undertaking CDD for existing customers will be determined by the risk rating assigned to a particular customer. The Regulator expects that customers rated high risk for money laundering should be reviewed more frequently than customers rated lower risk for money laundering.

3.

A Relevant Person should undertake CDD to guard against a range of money laundering risks as well as a range of financial crime risks, including fraud.
