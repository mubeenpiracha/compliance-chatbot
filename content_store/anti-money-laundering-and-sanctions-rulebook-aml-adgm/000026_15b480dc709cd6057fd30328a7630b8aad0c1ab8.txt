Basel Committee Standards

22.

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has published a set of guidelines for banks (Sound Management of Risks related to Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism, January 2014) which are intended to supplement FATF Recommendations. Banks operating in ADGM should read the Basel Committee guidelines in conjunction with FATF Recommendations and in complying with these Rules.

In the event that any of the Basel Committee guidelines conflict with a Rule in the AML Rulebook, the relevant Rule takes precedence.
