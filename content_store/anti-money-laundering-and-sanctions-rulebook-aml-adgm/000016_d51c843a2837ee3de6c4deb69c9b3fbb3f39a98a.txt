The AML Rulebook has been designed to provide a primary reference point for Relevant Persons that are supervised by the Regulator for AML/TFS compliance in accordance with the scope of application outlined in Rule 1.2.1. Accordingly it applies to all Relevant Persons, but to different degrees as provided in Rule 1.2.1(2). The AML Rulebook takes into consideration the fact that Relevant Persons have differing money laundering risk profiles. A Relevant Person should familiarise itself with the AML Rulebook and assess the extent to which the Chapters and sections apply to it. Relevant Persons should also ensure they are aware of, and take into account, all notices issued by the Regulator as well as relevant guidance and guidelines issued by governmental authorities in the UAE.
