respect to higher risk Transactions and customers.

Guidance

1.

The customer identification process does not end at the time of establishing a business relationship with a customer or, where relevant, undertaking a specific transaction or business activity on behalf of a customer. Following the start of the customer relationship, a Relevant Person should ensure that all relevant evidence and information is kept up to date including, for example, the list of authorised signatories who can act on behalf of a corporate customer.

2.

In complying with Rule 8.6.1(d), a Relevant Person should undertake a periodic review to ensure that non-static customer identity documentation is accurate and up to date. A Relevant Person is expected to ensure that the information and the evidence obtained from a customer is valid and has not expired, for example when obtaining copies of identification documentation such as a passport or identification card. Examples of non-static identity documentation include passport number and residential/business address and, for a Legal Person, its share register or list of partners.
