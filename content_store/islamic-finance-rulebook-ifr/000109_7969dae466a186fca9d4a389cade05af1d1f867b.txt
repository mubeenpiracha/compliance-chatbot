Islamic Financial Business policy and procedures manual

Guidance

A Fund Manager may, instead of having a separate Islamic Financial Business policy and procedures manual both at the firm level and at the Fund level, maintain a single Islamic Financial Business policy and procedures manual for the Fund Manager and the Funds it manages.

6.1.4 The Fund Manager of an Islamic Fund must implement and maintain an Islamic Financial Business policy and procedures manual for the Fund which addresses the following matters:

(a)

the manner in which the compliance function will be undertaken, in respect of Shari'a compliance;

(b)

the manner in which the Shari'a Supervisory Board will oversee and advise in regard to the Islamic Financial Business conducted by the Fund Manager;

(c)

the manner in which Shari'a Supervisory Board fatwa, rulings and guidelines will be recorded, disseminated and implemented and the internal Shari'a review undertaken;

(d)

the manner in which disputes between the Shari'a Supervisory Board and the Fund Manager in respect of Shari'a compliance will be addressed;
