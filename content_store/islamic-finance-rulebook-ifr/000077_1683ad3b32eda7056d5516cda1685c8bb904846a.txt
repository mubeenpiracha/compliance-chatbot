In an Unrestricted PSIA, the PSIA holder authorises the Authorised Person to invest the PSIA holder's funds in a manner which the Authorised Person deems appropriate without specifying any restrictions as to where, how or for what purpose the funds should be invested, provided that they are invested in a manner that complies with Shari'a. Under this arrangement, the Authorised Person can commingle the PSIA holder's funds with its own funds or with other funds which the Authorised Person has the right to invest on an unrestricted basis (i.e. funds from other Unrestricted PSIAs). The PSIA holders and the Authorised Person generally participate in the returns on the invested funds.
