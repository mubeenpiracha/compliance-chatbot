(iv) Where an Islamic Contract is not listed in Table 2, an Authorised Person should consult with the Regulator, on a case-by-case basis, to determine the:

(A)

contract type and the underlying investments or assets to calculate the E; and

(B)

appropriate risk weighting or the capital charge for such contract to calculate the CRW.

(v)

In some cases, as stipulated in the relevant parts of column 3 of Table 2, the calculation of capital requirement should be carried out as prescribed in PRU Rule A4.6.5 and in accordance with PRU Chapter 5.

(vi)

In determining the E of a Binding Murabaha for the Purchase Orderer (MPO), as per PRU Rule A4.6.5, E should equal the total acquisition cost of the asset (purchase price and other direct costs) less market value of the asset (net of any haircut) less any security deposit provided.

(vii)

In determining the E of Ijarah / Ijarah Munthia Bittamleek contract, as per PRU Rule A4.6.5, E should equal the total acquisition cost of the asset (purchase price and other direct costs) less the market value of the asset (net of any haircut), less any Arboun (earnest money deposit received from the potential lessee).

(viii)

In addition to paragraph 7 above, in the case of an Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek contract, the exposure may be reduced by the recovery value of the leased asset, only in cases where there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the leased asset can be repossessed and effectively redeployed as a leased asset to another Counterparty. This is important because the asset leased under the Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek contract is usually customised equipment or large pieces of equipment which are integrated with other assets of the lessee and hence are unsuitable for repossession and releasing to another lessee.

(ix)

In determining the E of an Istisna'a contract, the exposures arising from such a contract should not be netted off against exposures arising from a Parallel Istisna'a contract entered into by an Authorised Person for procuring the underlying investment for the Istisna'a contract.
