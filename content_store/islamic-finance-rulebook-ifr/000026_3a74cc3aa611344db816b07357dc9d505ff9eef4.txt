Family Takaful

(A)

Family Takaful deals with the provision of financial relief to the participants and/or their family in the event of misfortunes that relate to the death or disability of the participants. This category of Takaful normally requires the Takaful Operator to engage in a longer-term relationship over a defined number of years with the Takaful participants, throughout which the participant is required to make regular instalment payments in consideration for his or her participation in the Takaful scheme.

(B)

In Family Takaful, the paid Takaful contribution of a participant will usually be segregated into two accounts which feed two different funds. The first is the Participants' Investment Fund (PIF), and the aggregate PIFs constitute an investment fund for the purposes of capital formation. The second is the Participants' Risk Fund (PRF), which is a risk fund; that is, an element of the business that is inherent in the underwriting activities, and the contributions to which are made on the basis of Tabarru' commitment.
