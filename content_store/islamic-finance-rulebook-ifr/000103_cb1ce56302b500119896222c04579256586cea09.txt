ISLAMIC COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT FUNDS

Guidance

This chapter contains additional requirements that apply to a Collective Investment Fund operated or held out as being operated as an Islamic Fund. A Collective Investment Fund is defined in Part 11 of FSMR. The definition in Part 11 of FSMR is very wide and can capture some Islamic Financial Business. However, under Part 1 of FSMR and the Fund Rules, the Regulator can make Rules excluding certain arrangements or types of arrangements from constituting a Fund. Certain types of Islamic Financial Business are not regulated as Collective Investment Funds due to express exclusions provided. Key Islamic Financial Business-related exclusions under the collective investment regime are managing insurance (in the form of Takaful), participation rights evidenced by Sukuk certificates and Managing PSIAs.
