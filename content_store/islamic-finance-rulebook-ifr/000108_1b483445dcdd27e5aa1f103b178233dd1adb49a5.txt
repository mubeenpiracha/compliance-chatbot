Guidance

Although the Fund Managers of Exempt Funds and Qualified Investor Funds are not subject to the requirement for the appointment of a Shari'a Supervisory Board for such a Fund, they would need to ensure that the Exempt Funds or Qualified Investor Funds they manage continue to meet the Shari'a requirements applicable to the relevant Fund. They may use a member of the Shari'a Supervisory Board appointed at the firm level for the purposes of ascertaining compliance with the Shari'a requirements. The manner in which they demonstrate to the Unitholder of the Exempt Fund or Qualified Investor Fund as to how they achieve such compliance is a matter left to negotiation (i.e. subject to contractual terms) between the Unitholders and the Fund Manager.
