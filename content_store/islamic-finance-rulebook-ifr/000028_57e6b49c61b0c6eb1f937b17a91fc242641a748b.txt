(xvi) General Takaful

(A)

General Takaful schemes are basically contracts of joint guarantee on a short-term basis (normally one year), providing mutual compensation in the event of a specified type of loss. The schemes are designed to meet the needs for protection of individuals and corporate bodies in relation to material loss or damage resulting from a catastrophe or disaster inflicted upon real estate, assets or belongings of participants. The Takaful contribution paid is pooled into the PRF under the principle of Tabarru' to match the risk elements of the business that are inherent in its underwriting activities.

(B)

Although investment activities in the General Takaful pool or fund are secondary to the underwriting activities, they may be important for the solvency of the fund, especially in the case of longer-tailed risks.
