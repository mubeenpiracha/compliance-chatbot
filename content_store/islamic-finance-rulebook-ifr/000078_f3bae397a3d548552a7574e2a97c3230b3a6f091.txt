(iii)

In a Restricted PSIA, the PSIA holder imposes certain restrictions as to where, how and for what purpose the funds are to be invested. Further, the Authorised Person may be restricted from commingling its own funds with the restricted PSIA funds for the purposes of investment. In addition, there may be other restrictions that the PSIA holders may impose. In other words, the funds provided by holders of Restricted PSIAs are managed by the Authorised Person which does not have the right to use or dispose of the investments in which those funds are made except within the conditions of the relevant PSIA Investment Contract.
