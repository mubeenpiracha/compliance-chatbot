The issue of Financial Instruments that are Securities, such as Shares, Debentures (falling under paragraphs 88 or 90 of Schedule 1 of FSMR), Sukuk or Units attracts product-specific disclosure requirements such as the publication of a Prospectus or an Exempt Disclosure Statement. Where such Securities are included on the Official List of Securities or made via an Offer of Securities within ADGM, there are initial and ongoing disclosure and other obligations that apply to the Issuer/Reporting Entity under the MKT Rulebook. These MKT obligations are distinct from the obligations that apply to Recognised Bodies in respect of such Securities.
