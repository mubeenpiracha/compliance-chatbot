ISLAMIC COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT FUNDS

Guidance

This chapter contains additional requirements that apply to a Collective Investment Fund operated or held out as being operated as an Islamic Fund. A Collective Investment Fund is defined in Part 11 of FSMR. The definition in Part 11 of FSMR is very wide and can capture some Islamic Financial Business. However, under Part 1 of FSMR and the Fund Rules, the Regulator can make Rules excluding certain arrangements or types of arrangements from constituting a Fund. Certain types of Islamic Financial Business are not regulated as Collective Investment Funds due to express exclusions provided. Key Islamic Financial Business-related exclusions under the collective investment regime are managing insurance (in the form of Takaful), participation rights evidenced by Sukuk certificates and Managing PSIAs.

6.1

Application

6.1.1

(a)

This chapter applies in the case of a Domestic Fund:

IFR VER08.020125

(b)

The requirements that apply to a conventional Fund apply equally to an Islamic Fund, except as otherwise provided in this IFR 6.

(c)

In this IFR 6, except where otherwise provided, any reference to a Fund is to an Islamic Fund or to an Islamic Sub-Fund of an Umbrella Fund as the case may be and any reference to a Fund Manager is a reference to a Fund Manager of an Islamic Fund or a Fund Manager of an Islamic Sub-Fund of an Umbrella Fund.

Guidance

(i)

The Fund Rules contains the key requirements relating to the management and operation of conventional Collective Investment Funds. These Islamic Finance Rules set out the additional requirements that apply where such a Fund is managed or held out as being managed as an Islamic Fund. There are other requirements that apply to Authorised Persons managing Islamic Funds which are found in the Rulebooks, such as the GEN Rulebook, COBS Rulebook and PRU Rulebook.

(ii)

While IFR 3 contains the requirements that apply to Authorised Persons which are Fund Managers of Collective Investment Funds, the requirements in this IFR 6 mainly focus on Shari'a compliance related requirements that apply at the Fund level. For example, while the systems and controls required under IFR 3.3 relate to the systems and controls that a firm must have in order to comply with its Shari'a obligations, IFR 6.1.3 sets out systems and controls that must be established and maintained at the Fund level.

Systems and controls

6.1.2

(a)

The Fund Manager of a Fund must establish and maintain systems and controls which ensure that its management of the Fund and the Fund Property is Shari'a compliant.

(b)

A Fund Manager may, where it is practicable to do so, include the systems and controls required under IFR 6.1.2 (a) within those it is required to establish and maintain pursuant to IFR 3.3.1.

Guidance

(i)

Part 5 of the Fund Rules requires the Fund Manager to establish and maintain systems and controls, including, but not limited to, financial and risk controls to ensure sound management of the Fund in accordance with the Fund's Constitution and its most recent Prospectus, taking due account of the nature, scale and complexity of the Fund's investments and operations.

(ii)

IFR 3.3.1 requires a Fund Manager of an Islamic Fund to establish and maintain systems and controls to ensure the Shari'a compliance of that Islamic Fund.
