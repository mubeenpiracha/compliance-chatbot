MANAGING PROFIT SHARING INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS

5.1

Application

5.1.1 This chapter applies to an Authorised Person which conducts the Regulated Activity of

Managing a Profit Sharing Investment Account (PSIA).

Guidance

(i)

A PSIA does not constitute a Deposit, owing to the fact that a PSIA is managed in relation to property of any kind, and the risk of loss of capital remains with the client and is limited to the amount contributed to the PSIA by that client. Accordingly, an Authorised Person should take great care to ensure that a PSIA is not represented as a deposit, either directly or indirectly. The Regulator may conclude that the Authorised Person is accepting a deposit instead of Managing a PSIA in certain circumstances, for example, where the Authorised Person attaches to the investment account characteristics or facilities that are generally regarded to be those of a Deposit or current account such as providing:

(A)

an explicit or implicit guarantee to the client against the risk of loss of capital; or

(B)

a cheque book, an ATM card or a debit card.

5.2

Additional disclosure requirements for PSIAs

5.2.1 An Authorised Person must, prior to Managing a PSIA, provide written notice to the client that the client alone will bear any losses arising from the PSIA, which are limited to the amount of that client's contribution to the PSIA, unless there is negligence, misconduct or breach of contract on the part of the Authorised Person in Managing the PSIA in which case the losses caused by such negligence, misconduct or breach of contract shall be borne by the Authorised Person.
