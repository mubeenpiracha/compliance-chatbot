Inquiries and information

In assessing an application for a Licence or an endorsement on a Licence, the DFSA may:

(a)

make any enquiries which it considers appropriate, including enquiries independent of the applicant;

(b)

require the applicant to provide additional information;

(c)

require the applicant to have information on how it intends to ensure compliance with a particular requirement;

(d)

require any information provided by the applicant to be verified in any way that the DFSA specifies; and

(e)

take into account any information which it considers relevant.

(1)

In assessing an application for a Licence, the DFSA may, by means of written notice, indicate the legal form that the applicant may adopt to enable authorisation to be granted.

(2) Where the DFSA thinks it appropriate, it may treat an application made by one legal form or Person as having been made by the new legal form or Person.
