Guidance

1.

For the purposes of these Rules, the relevant definition of a Holding Company is found in the DIFC Companies Law. That definition provides when one body corporate is considered to be a holding company or a subsidiary of another body corporate and extends that concept to the ultimate holding company of the body corporate.

2.

Pursuant to Rule 8.1.2(1)(c), a Person becomes a Controller if that Person can exert significant management influence over an Authorised Market Institution. The ability to exert significant management influence can arise even where a Person, alone or with Associates, controls less than 10% of the shares or voting rights of the Authorised Market Institution or a Holding Company of that institution. Similarly, a Person may be able to exert significant management influence where such Person does not hold shares or voting rights but has exercisable rights to acquire shares or voting rights, such as under Options.
