Guidance

1.

This Rule is designed to address legal risks faced by a Clearing House, particularly where it operates in multiple jurisdictions. For example, an unexpected application of a law or regulation may render a contract between itself and a counterparty void or unenforceable, thereby leading to a loss.

2.

A Clearing House should be able to demonstrate to the DFSA that the legal basis on which it operates, including in multiple jurisdictions, is well founded. A well founded legal basis would generally include well defined rights and obligations of the Clearing House, its Members and other users, including its service providers such as custodians and settlement banks, or would provide a mechanism by which such rights and obligations can be ascertained. This would enable the Clearing House to identify and address risks that arise from its operations involving such parties.
