Crypto Tokens are not Securities or Investments. Therefore, they cannot be admitted to trading on an Exchange (only on an MTF) or to the Official List. In addition, a Crypto Token does not have a Reporting Entity or require an Approved Prospectus. However, a Crypto Token must be a Recognised Crypto Token (i.e, the DFSA must have recognised the Crypto Token as meeting specified criteria) before any Financial Service can be carried on in the DIFC in relation to the Crypto Token (see GEN section 3A). Therefore, only a Recognised Crypto Token can be admitted to trading on an MTF or cleared or settled by an Authorised Market Institution.
