Guidance

An Authorised Market Institution should have systems for identifying, and drawing to the attention of its senior management, situations where its commercial interests conflict, or may potentially conflict, with the proper performance of its Regulatory Functions. This would enable its senior management to take appropriate steps to ensure that such conflicts do not adversely affect the proper performance by the Authorised Market Institution of its Regulatory Functions. In particular, senior management should ensure that adequate human, financial and other resources (both in quantity and quality) are provided for risk management, regulatory, compliance and other similar functions.
