Guidance

1.

If the application for approval lodged with the DFSA does not contain all the required information, then the 90 day period runs from the date on which all the relevant information is provided to the DFSA.

2.

If a Person who has obtained prior DFSA approval for an acquisition of or an increase in the control in an Authorised Market Institution is unable to effect the acquisition before the end of the period referred to in Rule 8.2.3(2), it will need to obtain fresh approval from the DFSA.
