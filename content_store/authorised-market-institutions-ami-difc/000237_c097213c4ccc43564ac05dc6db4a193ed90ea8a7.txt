Guidance

1.

The Financial Service of Operating a Clearing House is defined in GEN Rule 2.18.1(1). This definition provides that Operating a Clearing House can be carried on by either the operator becoming a Central Counterparty (CCP) or by operating a Securities Settlement System (SSS) (i.e. a system that enables Investments to be transferred and settled by book entry), regardless of whether or not such a Person also acts as a Central Securities Depository (CSD) in respect of Securities cleared or settled on its facility and similar facilities.

2.

Where a Clearing House undertakes the function of acting as a CSD under its own Licence, the additional requirements in section 7.4 apply to it. The function of CSD may also be carried out by an Authorised Firm licensed to carry on the Financial Service of Providing Custody. See GEN definition in Rule 2.13.1(3). Such a firm is subject to similar requirements as in section 7.4, which are set out in COB section 10.2.
