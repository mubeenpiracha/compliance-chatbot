Guidance

1.

The period of 30 days will commence from the time the DFSA has received all the relevant information to assess the application.

2.

An Authorised Market Institution should consider submitting its application for DFSA approval well in advance of the date on which the proposed change is expected to come into effect, especially in the case of significant material changes to its existing arrangements, to allow the DFSA sufficient time to consider the application. Such timely submission would generally tend to avoid any extension of time being sought by the DFSA to assess properly the impact of a proposed change, due to its nature, scale and complexity. Such an extension would be made in consultation with the applicant.

3.

If a proposed material change is not approved by the DFSA within the 30 day period and the DFSA has not expressly extended the period beyond 30 days, an Authorised Market Institution may treat the proposed change as being rejected by the DFSA, and on that basis, may refer the decision to the FMT.
