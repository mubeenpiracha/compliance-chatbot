Guidance

1.

Final settlement is usually dependent on the legal environment of where the settlement occurs. Generally, in the case of certain assets, final settlement includes the transfer of title.

2.

Completing final settlement by the end of the value date is important because deferring final settlement to the next-business day can create both credit and liquidity pressures for a Clearing Houseâ€™s Members and other participants on its facilities and stakeholders. This may also be a potential source of systemic risk. Therefore, where possible, a Clearing House should provide intra-day or real-time settlement finality to reduce settlement risk.
