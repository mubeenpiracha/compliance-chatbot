Guidance

1.

The risk management framework should, for the purposes of Rule 7.2.1(2)(a), identify scenarios that may potentially prevent a Clearing House from being able to provide its critical operations and services as a going concern and assess the effectiveness of a full range of options for recovery or orderly wind-down.

2.

A Clearing House should prepare appropriate plans for resumption of its operations in such scenarios and, where it is not possible to do so, for an orderly wind-down of the operations of the Clearing House premised on the results of such assessments.

3.

Such procedures should also include appropriate early notification to the DFSA and other regulators as appropriate. See also the requirements in section 9.8 relating to disclosure to the DFSA.
