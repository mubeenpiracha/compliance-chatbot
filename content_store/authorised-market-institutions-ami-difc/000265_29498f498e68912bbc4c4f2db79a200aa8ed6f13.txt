only accept collateral with low credit, liquidity, and market risks; and

(b)

set and enforce appropriately conservative haircuts and concentration limits.

(2)

A Clearing House must, for the purposes of meeting the requirement in (1), establish and implement a collateral management system that is well designed and operationally flexible. Such a system must, at a minimum:

(a)

limit the assets it accepts as collateral to those with low credit, liquidity, and market risks;

(b)

establish prudent valuation practices and develop haircuts that are regularly tested and take into account stressed market conditions;

(c)

to reduce the need for procyclical adjustments, establish, to the extent practicable and prudent, stable and conservative haircuts that are calibrated to include periods of stressed market conditions;

(d)

avoid concentrated holdings of certain assets where that would significantly impair the ability to liquidate such assets quickly without significant adverse price effects; and
