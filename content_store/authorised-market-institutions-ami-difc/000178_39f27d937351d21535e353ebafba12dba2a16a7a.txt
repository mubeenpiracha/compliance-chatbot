Guidance

1.

To make an informed decision about whether to buy or sell a Crypto Token traded on a MTF, users need accurate and up-to-date information about matters that may affect the price of the Crypto Token. As there is no Reporting Entity for a Crypto Token, the Authorised Market Institution is responsible for ensuring that adequate ongoing information about the Crypto Token is available.

2.

Ongoing information may be published by the Authorised Market Institution on its website, or the Authorised Market Institution may provide links on its website to a site where the information can be found. If the Authorised Market Institution provides links to the information, the links should take a user directly to the relevant information and the site should contain reliable information.

3.

Under Rule 5B.4.3(2)(e) and (3), an Authorised Market Institution is required to disclose that a person has a significant holding even if it is not reasonably able to establish their identity.
