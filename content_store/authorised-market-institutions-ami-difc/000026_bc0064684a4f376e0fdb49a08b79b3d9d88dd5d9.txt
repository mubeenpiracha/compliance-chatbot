Guidance

1.

The activity of operating a Multilateral Trading Facility (“MTF”) is an activity that falls within the definition of the Financial Service of Operating an Alternative Trading System (see GEN Rule 2.22.1). A Person needs to be Licensed as an Authorised Firm to carry on that Financial Service. However, pursuant to GEN Rule 2.2.12, a holder of a Licence to Operate an Exchange may also operate an MTF if it has obtained an endorsement on its Licence permitting it to do so.

2.

Acting as a Trade Repository is not a Financial Service, and may be carried on by an Authorised Firm or Authorised Market Institution with an endorsement on its Licence permitting it to do so (see GEN Rule 2.2.13).

3.

A new applicant for a Licence or an existing holder of a Licence may apply to have an endorsement on its Licence to operate a Multilateral Trading Facility or to maintain a Trade Repository.
