In particular, a CCP should establish explicit rules and procedures that address fully any credit losses it may face as a result of any individual or combined default among its Members and other participants with respect to any of their obligations to the CCP. Such rules and procedures should address how any potentially uncovered credit losses would be allocated, including the repayment of any funds the CCP may borrow from its liquidity providers. They should also indicate the CCPâ€™s process to replenish any financial resources that it may employ during a stress event, so that it can continue to operate in a safe and sound manner.

A CCP should document its supporting rationale for, and should have appropriate governance arrangements relating to, the amount of total financial resources it maintains. It should also have clear procedures to report the results of its stress tests to its Governing Body and senior management as appropriate, and use those results to evaluate the adequacy of its total financial resources and make any adjustments as appropriate.
