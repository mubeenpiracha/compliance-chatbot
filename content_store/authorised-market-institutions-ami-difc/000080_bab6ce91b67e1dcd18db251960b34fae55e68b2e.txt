Outsourcing

(1) Without limiting the generality of the requirements in GEN Rules 5.3.21 and 5.3.22, an Authorised Market Institution must, before entering into any material outsourcing arrangements with a service provider, obtain the DFSA’s prior approval to do so.

(2)

For avoidance of doubt, the requirement in (1) applies to any outsourcing arrangements which were not in existence at the time the Authorised Market Institution was granted its Licence.

(3)

In order to obtain the DFSA’s prior approval for outsourcing arrangements referred to in (1), an Authorised Market Institution must follow those procedures for obtaining the DFSA’s prior approval for material changes specified in Rule 4.3.1(1).

(4)

The procedures in Schedule 3 to the Regulatory Law apply to a decision of the DFSA under this Rule to refuse to approve an outsourcing arrangement.
