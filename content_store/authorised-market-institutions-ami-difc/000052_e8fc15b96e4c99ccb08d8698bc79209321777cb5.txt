Governance

(1)

An Authorised Market Institution must have:

(a)

a corporate governance framework appropriate to the nature, scale and complexity of its business and structure, which is adequate to promote the sound and prudent management and oversight of the Authorised Market Institutionâ€™s business and to protect the interests of its stakeholders; and

(b)

a remuneration structure and strategies which are well aligned with the long term interests of the Authorised Market Institution, and appropriate to the nature, scale and complexity of its business.

(2) Without limiting the generality of the requirements in GEN chapter 5, an Authorised Market Institution must ensure that its Governing Body has a sufficient number of independent members at all times.
