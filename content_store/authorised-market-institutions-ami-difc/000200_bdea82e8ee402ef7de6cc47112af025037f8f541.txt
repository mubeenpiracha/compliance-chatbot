When making disclosure, an Exchange should adopt a technical mechanism by which the public can differentiate between transactions that have been transacted in the central order book and transactions that have been reported to the Exchange as off-order book transactions. Any transactions that have been cancelled pursuant to its rules should also be identifiable.

The reference to trading interest in Rule 6.4.2(2)(b) includes any actionable indications of interests. Actionable interests are messages from one Member to another in a trading system about available trading interest that contains all necessary information to agree on a trade.
