DFSA’s general approach to resolution planning

5.

The DFSA will aim to approach resolution planning proportionally, taking into account its Resolution Objectives, including the systemic importance of the Authorised Firm or its Group, the need to maintain Critical Functions, protect depositors and Client Assets as well as, more broadly, the impact on and the reputation of the DIFC. Proportionality also implies that the DFSA’s approach will take account of the nature, complexity, interconnectedness, level of substitutability, size and extent of cross- border operations of the Authorised Firm.

6.

The DFSA will consider all potential, credible and feasible options for a resolution strategy for an Authorised Firm, including, where possible, options with respect to the position of the Authorised Firm in its Group Resolution Plan prepared by the home Resolution Authority, provided its relevant parts are available to the DFSA.

7.

The DFSA will cooperate, to the extent possible, with the home Resolution Authority and any other relevant Resolution Authorities.
