Write Down or Conversion Power

The DFSA may in writing down or converting any instrument or liability relating to an Authorised Firm:

(a)

reduce, including reducing to zero, the principal amount of, or outstanding amount due, in respect of Eligible Liabilities of the Authorised Firm;

(b)

cancel Debt Instruments issued by the Authorised Firm, except secured liabilities;

(c)

reduce, including reducing to zero, the nominal amount of Shares of the Authorised Firm and cancel the Shares;

(d)

require the Authorised Firm to issue new Shares or other capital instruments, including preference Shares and contingent convertible instruments.

(2) A Pre-Resolution Valuation or a Provisional Valuation (as the case may be) shall form the basis of the calculation of the write down to be applied to the relevant capital instruments in order to absorb losses and the level of conversion to be applied to the relevant capital instruments in order to recapitalize the Authorised Firm.
