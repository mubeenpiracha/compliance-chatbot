 the Recovery Planning process, including providing to the DFSA any information relevant for the review of the Recovery Plan.

(2)

The Authorised Firm shall notify the DFSA of the Senior Manager designated under (1).

(3) Without limiting the generality of the Principles for Authorised Individuals in GEN Rule 4.4, the senior management of an Authorised Firm are responsible for the Recovery Planning of that Authorised Firm.

Scope of the Recovery Plan

2.1.6 A Recovery Plan prepared by an Authorised Firm shall be prepared on the

following basis:

(a)

if the Authorised Firm has its head office in the DIFC, the Recovery Plan shall cover the recovery of the entire Group;

(b)

if the Authorised Firm is a Subsidiary of a Financial Institution that has its head office outside the DIFC, the Recovery Plan shall specifically address stress scenarios and triggers for the Authorised Firm and adequately cover any downstream operations, as well as including specific recovery options for the DIFC operations; and

(c)

if the Authorised Firm is a Branch of a Regulated Financial Institution, the Recovery Plan may generally be part of the Group plan, provided the Recovery Plan adequately covers the DIFC operations.

Guidance

1.

For a Branch with significant DIFC operations, the Recovery Plan should be tailored to the local operations and contain all relevant information. For a Branch with limited operations, the DFSA may accept considerable reliance on a Group plan, provided the Branch can demonstrate how the Recovery Plan options can be effectively applied to address stress events that pose a risk to the Branch’s viability.

2.

The DFSA will approach the Recovery Plan requirements in a proportionate manner.

Content of the Recovery Plan

2.1.7 A Recovery Plan shall be commensurate with the nature, complexity, interconnectedness, size and substitutability of the Authorised Firm’s DIFC operations, and set out the Recovery Measures the Authorised Firm can take, as well as how and when it can take them, including the following key
