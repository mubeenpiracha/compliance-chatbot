Guidance

1.

For a Branch with significant DIFC operations, the Recovery Plan should be tailored to the local operations and contain all relevant information. For a Branch with limited operations, the DFSA may accept considerable reliance on a Group plan, provided the Branch can demonstrate how the Recovery Plan options can be effectively applied to address stress events that pose a risk to the Branchâ€™s viability.

2.

The DFSA will approach the Recovery Plan requirements in a proportionate manner.
