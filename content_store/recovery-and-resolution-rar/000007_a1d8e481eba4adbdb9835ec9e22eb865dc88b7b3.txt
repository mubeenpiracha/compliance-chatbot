RECOVERY AND RESOLUTION (RAR)

has been sufficiently taken into account, it may limit its resolution planning to anticipating actions and expressing acceptance of the Group Resolution Plan. This would often imply that, in the event of Resolution, the DFSA would aim to take measures in the DIFC consistent with the home Resolution Authority’s actions taken in line with the Group Resolution Plan. If the DFSA is not satisfied that the Group Resolution Plan meets or is consistent with its Resolution Objectives, it will consider whether it is necessary to pursue alternative or independent strategies as the preferred resolution strategy in the DIFC. The DFSA will attempt to ensure, as far as it is possible, that the DIFC Resolution Plan is as consistent as possible with the Group Resolution Plan.
