As the purpose of the DFSA’s approach is to allow a business to test and develop its innovative technology, and not to carry on a fully operational business, the DFSA would expect the business to use the simplified regulatory framework only for a limited period. It is, therefore, likely to grant waivers and modifications only for a finite period, normally twelve to twenty-four months. In exceptional cases, it may consider extending that period.

When the testing period ends, the business would be expected either:

(a)

if the testing is successful, to carry on its business on a broader scale, in which case it will need to demonstrate to the DFSA’s satisfaction that it is able to comply fully with relevant legal and regulatory requirements before the DFSA will remove the various restrictions and conditions; or

(b)

to cease carrying on activities in the DIFC, in which case it should implement its exit plan and ensure that all obligations to customers are fulfilled.
