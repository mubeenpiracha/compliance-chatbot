It is not uncommon for certain cryptocurrencies to provide the holder with rights of early access or discounts on the native blockchain (for example, where the cryptocurrency is the virtual currency on the native crypto exchange). However, these limited rights do not change the nature of the cryptocurrency as these rights have limited impact on the nature and value of the Token.

Stablecoins, as opposed to other cryptocurrencies, aim to maintain a stable price through a direct one-to-one peg against a fiat currency (usually, the US dollar) or by pegging their value to other assets, such as commodities or other cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins usually claim to have a reserve of assets to back their peg. These assets are purchased using the funds provided by purchasers of the stablecoins. Stablecoins are often used to enter and exit blockchain-based trading systems, where the use of fiat currency is limited, as well as to make payments and transfers between users.
