 immediate revocation of such access if the conditions for granting approval are no longer met.

(3)

An Authorised Person must implement appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorised physical access to its data centres and server rooms.

Guidance

1.

The DFSA expects that where physical access is granted to individuals who are not members of an Authorised Person’s staff they are accompanied at all times while performing their tasks.

2.

The DFSA expects that an Authorised Person monitors and records activities that take place inside its data centres and server rooms.

5.5.14 (1)

An Authorised Person must establish and maintain a comprehensive cybersecurity training programme and adequate awareness arrangements.

(2)

The programme and arrangements in (1) must ensure that all relevant Employees:

(a)

receive training, at least annually, on the Authorised Person’s cybersecurity policies and standards;

101

GEN/VER67/03-25

GENERAL (GEN)

(b) develop and maintain appropriate awareness of, and

competencies for, detecting and reporting Cyber Incidents; and

(c) understand their individual responsibilities.

Guidance

1.

An Authorised Person should regularly review and, where necessary, update its training programme to ensure that it remains current and relevant. The review should take into consideration the evolving nature of technology as well as emerging Cyber Risks.

2.

A relevant Employee would include any member of staff with access to an Authorised Person’s IT Systems or Networks or any other Employee who might otherwise be exposed to, or targeted by, a Cyber Incident.

3.

New Employees should receive training within a reasonable period of joining the Authorised Person.

4.

The DFSA expects Employees with privileged access rights to receive targeted security training that reflects their rights and responsibilities.

5.5.15 An Authorised Person must ensure that:

(a)

it has in place a comprehensive programme to test the resilience of its IT Systems and Networks and its processes and controls implemented to comply with Rules 5.5.6 to 5.5.14;

(b)

testing under the programme is carried out regularly, and in the case of internet facing systems, at least annually; and

(c)

it has in place a process to prioritise and remedy adverse testing outcomes.

Guidance

1.

An Authorised Person should use a range of methods to test its IT Systems and Networks and processes and controls, including:

a.

vulnerability assessments;

b.

scenario-based testing;

c.

penetration tests; and

d.

red team exercises,

depending on the outcome of the Authorised Person’s cyber risk assessment under Rule 5.5.5(2).

2.

The frequency with which an Authorised Person should carry out testing will depend on the nature, scale and complexity of its business. For some Authorised Persons it may be adequate to test annually but for others it may be necessary to carry out tests more frequently. The DFSA expects additional tests to be carried out whenever systems are updated or new systems are implemented, including when systems are changed to address any vulnerabilities that have been identified during testing.

Detection, response and recovery

102

GEN/VER67/03-25

GENERAL (GEN)

5.5.16 (1)

An Authorised Person must continuously monitor its IT Systems and Networks with a view to detecting:

(a)

Cyber Incidents; and

(b)

the occurrence of anomalies and events indicating a potential Cyber Incident.

(2)

An Authorised Person must have a process for escalating actual or potential Cyber Incidents.

Guidance

1.

An Authorised Person’s ability to detect an actual or potential Cyber Incident is essential for strong cyber resilience. Early detection provides an Authorised Person with useful lead time to take appropriate measures.

2.

As part of its monitoring, the DFSA expects an Authorised Person to regularly review system logs, warnings, errors and security events to identify suspicious activities and system errors indicating a potential Cyber Incident.

3.

The process for escalating actual or potential Cyber Incidents should define a point of contact for reporting incidents. All Employees should be made aware of their responsibility to report actual or potential Cyber Incidents as quickly as possible.

5.5.17 (1)

An Authorised Person must draw up and maintain a robust Cyber Incident Response Plan providing for measures to be taken by the Authorised Person to respond to and limit consequences of a Cyber Incident.

(2)

The Cyber include appropriate conditions and procedures to ensure the timely implementation of response and recovery
