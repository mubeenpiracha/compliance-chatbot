BUSINESS TRANSFER SCHEMES

Guidance

1.

Part 9 of the Regulatory Law (“Part 9”) sets out provisions relating to financial services business transfer schemes (“transfer schemes”). Article 106 provides that no transfer scheme is to have effect unless a Court order has been made in relation to the scheme. Article 108 provides that the Court may make an order sanctioning a transfer scheme.

2.

The DFSA may under Article 113 of the Regulatory Law make Rules providing for provisions of Part 9 to have effect in specified cases with modifications. This chapter sets out such Rules.

3.

The intended effect of the Rules in this chapter when read with Part 9 is that:

(a)

a Banking transfer scheme and an Insurance transfer scheme (as defined in this chapter) must continue to comply with all relevant requirements in Part 9 and such a scheme does not take effect unless a Court order has been made in relation to it under Article 108; and

(b)

a transfer scheme, other than a scheme referred to in (a) or a scheme relating to a Domestic Fund, is not required to be sanctioned by a Court order under Article 108 if certain conditions set out in Rule 12.1.4 are met.
