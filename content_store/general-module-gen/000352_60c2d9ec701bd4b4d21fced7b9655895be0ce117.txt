Guidance

1.

In considering the location of an Authorised Firm’s or Authorised Market Institution’s head office, the DFSA will have regard to the location of its directors, partners and senior management and to the main location of its day-to-day operational, control, management and administrative arrangements and will judge matters on a case by case basis.

2.

An Authorised Firm, Authorised Market Institution or an applicant for authorisation which does not satisfy the DFSA with respect to the location of its offices will, on this point alone not be considered fit and proper or able to satisfy the Licensing Requirements.

3.

The DFSA expects all Authorised Persons to have a physical presence, including Employees, in the DIFC. The DFSA does not permit ‘brass plate’ operations i.e. offices with the name of the entity but with no staff or where no meaningful activity takes place.

4.

The Companies Law, Limited Partnership Law and General Partnership Law of the DIFC also require entities to which they apply, to have a registered office in the DIFC, and to carry on their principal business activity in the DIFC.
