Guidance

The DFSA will generally not withdraw a no objection position it has conveyed to an Authorised Firm, except in very limited circumstances. An example of such a situation is where the Authorised Firm is found to have provided to the DFSA inaccurate or incomplete information and that commission or omission has a material impact on the DFSAâ€™s no objection decision.

11.10.12 (1)

The procedures in Schedule 3 to the Regulatory Law apply to a decision of the DFSA under Rules 11.10.9, 11.10.10 and 11.10.11 to object to an acquisition or to impose or vary conditions.

(2)

If the DFSA decides to exercise its power under Rule 11.10.9, 11.10.10 or 11.10.11 to object to an acquisition or to impose or vary conditions, the Authorised Firm may refer the matter to the FMT for review.
