GENERAL (GEN)

Guidance

The nature and extent of the systems and controls of an Authorised Person will depend upon a variety of factors including the nature, scale and complexity of its business. While all Authorised Persons, irrespective of the nature, scale, and complexity of their business and legal structure or organisation need to comply with this chapter, the DFSA will take into account these factors and the differences that exist between Authorised Persons when assessing the adequacy of an Authorised Person’s systems and controls. Nevertheless, neither these factors nor the differences relieve an Authorised Person from compliance with its regulatory obligations.
