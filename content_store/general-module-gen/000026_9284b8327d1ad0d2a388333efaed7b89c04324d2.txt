1. The exclusions in Rules 2.19.3 and 2.19.3A apply to certain Insurance Intermediation activities which occur in the course of carrying on other businesses.

2. Rule 2.19.3 applies to activities carried on as a necessary part of a professional service, such as insurance advice provided by an accountant or solicitor as part of estate planning or tax advice.

3. Rule 2.19.3A applies to activities that are ancillary and complementary to a business of providing goods or services. This might include, for example, a travel agent arranging travel insurance or a supplier of electrical goods arranging insurance of those goods.
