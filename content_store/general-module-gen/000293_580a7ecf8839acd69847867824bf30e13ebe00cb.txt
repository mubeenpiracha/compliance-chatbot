Application to Branches and Groups

2.

As part of the flexible and proportionate application of corporate governance standards to firms, whether a firm is a Branch or a subsidiary within a Group is also taken into account. As such, the considerations noted in Guidance items 8 â€“ 9 under Rule 5.3.30 apply equally to the application of the remuneration related requirements for Branches and Groups. For example, where an Authorised Person is a member of a Group, its Governing Body should consider whether the Group wide policies, such as those relating to the Employees covered under the remuneration strategy and the disclosure relating to remuneration made at the Group level are adequate to meet its obligations under Rule 5.3.31.
