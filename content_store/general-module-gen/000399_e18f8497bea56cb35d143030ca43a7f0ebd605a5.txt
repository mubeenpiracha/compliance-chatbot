Guidance

The DFSA has exercised its power under Article 99(5) of the Regulatory Law to exempt an Authorised Person which is a Representative Office from the requirements in that Article. As a result, in accordance with the terms of Article 99(5), the Representative Office also does not need to comply with other requirements in chapters 4, 5 and 6 of Part 8 of that Law.
