Guidance

1.

Rule 3A.2.4 prohibits Authorised Persons (i.e. Persons that are authorised under a Licence to provide Financial Services) from also carrying on unregulated business relating to certain Excluded Tokens i.e. Utility Tokens and NFTs. The only exception is that an Authorised Person that is permitted to Provide Custody may also carry on that activity in relation to Utility Tokens and NFTs.

2.

The prohibition is intended to avoid any misconception by users of a service that regulatory requirements for Financial Services apply to the unregulated part of the business. The prohibition does not extend to the use of digital currencies issued by governments, government agencies, central banks or other monetary authorities. Therefore, an Authorised Person may provide a service or carry on an activity involving such a digital currency.

Guidance

1.

Under Rule 3A.2.5, a Money Services Provider is generally prohibited from using Crypto Tokens in connection with its Money Services business. The only exception is that a Money Services Provider may use a Fiat Crypto Token (i.e. a fiat stablecoin) for specified purposes. A Money Services provider is also prohibited from carrying on other Financial Services relating to Crypto Tokens, for example, it cannot deal as principal or agent or arrange transactions relating to Crypto Tokens.

2.

A Money Services Provider is not however prohibited from using Distributed Ledger Technology or other similar technology as the technological platform for its Money Service operations. For example, an Authorised Firm may use a private blockchain offered by a reputable technology provider to facilitate payment transactions and money transmission initiated by their Clients. In that case, the use of blockchain and any tokens, where applicable, must serve the sole purpose of facilitating the

technology side of the business and supporting the back-office operations.

3.

Firms should take due care that their Clients are not exposed to the risks arising from the use of blockchain. For example, that Clients are not sending, holding, or receiving any Tokens under their name, and that the Client agreement is limited to using fiat currency. Depending on the arrangement, the use of blockchain may be an outsourcing of technology to a third-party service provider. The Authorised Firm will

comply with the relevant provisions in GEN 5.3.21 and 5.3.22.
