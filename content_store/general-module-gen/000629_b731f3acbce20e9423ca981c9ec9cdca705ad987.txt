An arrangement is in place under which people contribute their money on the invitation of Firm B (the Fund Manager in this example), in exchange for Tokens. These people make their contributions in the expectation that Firm B will pool those contributions to buy fine art, manage a business of hiring the fine art for corporate events to generate income, and also sell some art to make capital gains. The further expectation is that Firm B will distribute such income and capital gains to the contributors, pro rata to the amounts they contributed. This arrangement is a Fund. If the Tokens issued by Firm B to participants confer on them the rights to participate as expected in the profits and income of the arrangement, such a Token confers on the participants rights that are substantially similar in nature to a Unit in a Fund and so it is a Security Token that is considered a Unit.
