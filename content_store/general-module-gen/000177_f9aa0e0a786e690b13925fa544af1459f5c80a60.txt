Guidance

1.

Article 41A(3) of the Regulatory Law defines a Financial Promotion as:

“[A]ny communication, however made, which invites or induces a Person to:

(a)

enter into, or offer to enter into, an agreement in relation to the provision of a financial service; or

(b)

exercise any rights conferred by a financial product or acquire, dispose of, underwrite or convert a financial product.”

2.

The Guidance in this chapter is designed to help explain the scope of the Financial Promotions Prohibition.

3.

The definition of a Financial Promotion is very broad and encompasses the definitions of a “financial promotion” in Article 19(3) of the Collective Investment Law 2010. A Financial Promotion also includes “marketing material” of the type referred to in COB Rule 3.2.4(2).

4.

The DFSA considers that a Financial Promotion may be made in any manner and by any form including, but not limited to, an oral, electronic or written communication and includes an advertisement, or any form of promotion or marketing. A disclaimer stating that a communication is not a Financial Promotion would not, on its own, prevent a communication from being a Financial Promotion.
