Best practice relating to corporate governance

10.

In addition to the considerations noted above, best practice that an Authorised Person may adopt to achieve compliance with the applicable corporate governance standards is set out in Guidance at Appendix 3.1. An Authorised Person may, where the best practice set out in App3.1 is not suited to its particular business or structure, deviate from such best practice or any aspects thereof. The DFSA will expect the Authorised Person to demonstrate to the DFSA, upon request, what the deviations are and why such deviations are considered by the Authorised Person to be appropriate.
