Guidance

1.

In presenting information relating to past performance of a financial product or financial service, a Person should use a reputable independent actuarial, financial or statistical reporting service provider.

2.

The effect of Rule 3.5.1(2) is that a Person who is licensed and regulated by a Financial Services Regulator in the UAE is not required to comply with Rule 3.5.1(1) when communicating with an existing client or with a prospective client in relation to a Passported Fund where the DIFC is a Host Jurisdiction. However, when making any other Financial Promotion to a prospective client in the DIFC, Rule 3.5.1(1) does apply to such Persons, as do the prohibitions on the making of offers contained in the Markets Law 2012 and Collective Investment Law 2010 respectively. The exclusion in Rule 3.5.1(2) applies only if the Person is complying with the financial promotion requirements of its Financial Services Regulator in the UAE.

3.5.2 A Person must not, in any Financial Promotion, attempt to limit or avoid any duty or liability it may have under any DFSA-administered laws or the Rules.
