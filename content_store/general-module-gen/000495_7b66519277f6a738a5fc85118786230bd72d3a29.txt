Guidance

1.

Under Rule 5.3.20, an Authorised Firm must establish and maintain systems and controls that ensure that it and its employees do not engage in market abuse or facilitate others to engage in market abuse, whether in the DIFC or elsewhere. Rule 11.10.12A requires the firm to notify the DFSA if it reasonably suspects that a clientâ€™s order or transaction may constitute Market Abuse under Part 6 of the Markets Law.

2.

In some cases, a suspicion of Market Abuse may arise when an order is received. In other cases, it may not be apparent until a transaction is executed or when viewed in the context of later information, behaviour or transactions. When a firm submits a notification, it should be able to explain to the DFSA its reasons for suspecting that the order or transaction may constitute Market Abuse.
