Making referrals relating to Crypto Tokens

3A.2.6 An Authorised Firm must not refer a client to a person providing any service related to a Crypto Token, unless it is reasonably satisfied that the person is either:

(a)

an Authorised Firm; or

(b)

a Regulated Financial Institution outside the DIFC that is subject to substantially similar requirements to those that apply to an Authorised Firm carrying on Crypto Business in or from the DIFC.

Guidance

An Authorised Firm needs to carry out proper due diligence to satisfy itself, on reasonable grounds, that the person to which it intends to refer its client is subject to substantially similar requirements to those that apply to an Authorised Firm carrying on Crypto Business in or from the DIFC. This due diligence needs to be undertaken before making the referral. The Authorised Firm should be able to demonstrate to the DFSA the basis upon which it has reasonably concluded that the requirements are substantially the same.

3A.3 Recognition of a Crypto Token

3A.3.1 Any of the following Persons may apply to the DFSA for a Crypto Token to be

recognised in the DIFC:

(a)

an Authorised Person;

(b)

an applicant for a Licence to be an Authorised Person; or

(c)

an issuer or developer of the Crypto Token.

3A.3.2 An applicant must apply using the appropriate form specified by the DFSA.

3A.3.3 In assessing an application, the DFSA may:

(a)

make any enquiries which it considers appropriate, including enquiries independent of the applicant;

(b)

require the applicant to provide additional information;

(c)

require the applicant to have information on how it intends to ensure compliance with any criteria;

(d)

require any information provided by the applicant to be verified in any way that the DFSA specifies; and

(e)

take into account any information which it considers relevant in making a suitability assessment.

3A.3.4 (1) The DFSA may recognise a Crypto Token if it is satisfied that:

GEN/VER67/03-25

GENERAL (GEN)

(a)

having regard to the matters in (2), the Crypto Token is suitable for use in the DIFC;

(b)

it is not a Privacy Token or an Algorithmic Token; and

(c)

for a Fiat Crypto Token, all of the requirements in (4) are met in respect of that Fiat Crypto Token (in addition to the criteria in (a) and (b) above).

(2) The matters referred to in (1)(a) are:

(a)

the regulatory status of the Crypto Token in other jurisdictions, including whether it has been assessed or approved for use by a Regulator in another Recognised Jurisdiction;

(b) whether there is adequate transparency relating to the Crypto Token, including sufficient detail about its purpose, protocols, consensus mechanism, governance arrangements, founders, key persons, miners and significant holders;

(c)

the size, liquidity and volatility of the market for the Crypto

Token globally;

(d)

the adequacy and suitability of the technology used in connection with the Crypto Token; and

(e) whether risks associated with the Crypto Token are adequately mitigated, including risks relating to governance, legal and regulatory issues, cybersecurity, money laundering, market abuse and other financial crime.

(3)

The DFSA may, in assessing the matters in (2), consider the cumulative effect of factors which, if taken individually, may be regarded as insufficient to give reasonable cause to doubt that the criteria in (1)(a) is satisfied.

(4)

In the case of a Fiat Crypto Token, the additional criteria referred to in (1)(c) are that:

(a)

the Crypto Token is able to maintain a stable price relative to the fiat currency it references;

(b)

the reserves:

(i)

are at least equal in value to the notional value of outstanding Crypto Tokens in circulation (that value being calculated by multiplying the number of Crypto Tokens in circulation by the purported pegged fiat currency value);

(ii)

are denominated in the reference currency;

(iii)

are held in assets that are likely to maintain their value, including during periods of stress, are highly liquid, are appropriately diversified and carry minimal credit risk;

(iv)

are valued daily; and
