12.1.5

(1)

An Authorised Firm or transferee may apply in writing to the DFSA seeking its consent to a transfer scheme.

(2)

The DFSA may consent in writing to the transfer scheme if it is reasonably satisfied that:

(a)

the scheme is not a transfer scheme referred to in Rule 12.1.3;

(b)

it is more appropriate and proportionate, and in the overall interests of Clients affected by the scheme, for the Authorised Firm or transferee to seek the DFSA’s consent rather than applying to the Court for an order sanctioning the scheme;

(c)

the Authorised Firm or transferee has taken all reasonable steps to pursue other options for giving effect to the scheme;

(d)

the scheme is not likely to result in any material prejudice to the interests of Clients of the Authorised Firm; and

(e)

implementation of the scheme will not result in the Authorised Firm or transferee contravening any applicable law or Rule.

(3)

The procedures in Schedule 3 to the Law apply to a decision of the DFSA under (2) to refuse to give its consent to a transfer scheme.

(4)

If the DFSA decides to refuse to give its consent under this Rule, the Authorised Firm may refer the matter to the FMT for review.

Guidance

1.

The DFSA expects to receive applications seeking its consent to a transfer scheme only in limited circumstances, and if the scheme is not complex or contentious. If a scheme is likely to be contentious or complex, then it is more appropriate for an application to be made to the Court.

GENERAL (GEN)

The DFSA will not give its consent unless the applicant can demonstrate that it has taken all reasonable steps to pursue other options for implementing the scheme, such as seeking the consent of affected Clients or using existing agreements with Clients.

The DFSA also will not give its consent in cases such as where:

(a)

the transfer scheme is likely to materially prejudice the interests of Clients;

(b)

due to the complexity of the transfer scheme it is unclear what the precise impact of the scheme will be on Clients or whether it will be legally effective; or

(c)

implementation of the transfer scheme will result in the Authorised Firm or transferee breaching a requirement in a law or Rule, for example, if the transferee does not have the necessary authorisation to conduct that business or if the transfer will result in the Authorised Firm or transferee breaching a prudential requirement.

The type of case where the DFSA anticipates giving its consent to a transfer scheme is where the scheme is relatively simple and the applicant has taken all reasonable steps to pursue other options but has been unable to complete the necessary processes because, for example, a small number of Clients do not respond.

FACILITATING INNOVATION

Guidance

Introduction

1.

This chapter sets out the DFSA’s approach to dealing with businesses that wish to test innovative financial technology in or from the DIFC. In particular, it sets out how the DFSA will consider using its powers to waive or modify Rules for such businesses.

2.

In this way the DFSA may create a simplified regulatory framework tailored to the specific business proposal. This will allow the business to test innovative uses of technology, potentially resulting in new financial products or services without having to comply with Rules that may be inappropriate or disproportionate given the innovative nature of the business and that it is only at a testing stage.

3.

The DFSA would however expect a business, once it is fully operational, to be able to comply with all relevant Rules applicable to the type of activities it carries on.

Businesses that can use this approach

4.

To be considered for this approach, a business should, before submitting a Licence application, demonstrate to the satisfaction of the DFSA, that:

(a)

there is a genuine need to test technology in a way that involves the carrying on of one or more Financial Services (i.e. it is within the scope of activities that the DFSA regulates);

(b)

testing will involve the use of innovative technology by offering a new type of financial product or service or by applying innovative technology to an existing financial product or service;

(c)

it is ready to start
