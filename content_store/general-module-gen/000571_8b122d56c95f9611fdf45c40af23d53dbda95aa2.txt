Example 1

An individual artist has created a Token that represents a one-of-a-kind piece of art. This Token is to be sold by auction. The owner will then be able to sell the Token to a new owner, should they wish to do so. This Token would be a NFT.

Example 2

Company A invests in art using the funds it receives and pools from investors. It then issues Tokens to those investors in proportion to their contributions. The Tokens also entitle the holders to receive a share of the fees generated by art rental, and the profits if the art sells. They have no control over the decisions taken by Company A in respect of the art. These Tokens are likely to constitute Units in a Collective Investment Fund.
