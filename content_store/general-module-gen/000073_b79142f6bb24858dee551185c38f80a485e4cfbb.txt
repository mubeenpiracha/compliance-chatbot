Guidance

1.

In considering the location of an Authorised Firm’s or Authorised Market Institution’s head office, the DFSA will have regard to the location of its directors, partners and senior management and to the main location of its day-to-day operational, control, management and administrative arrangements and will judge matters on a case by case basis.

2.

An Authorised Firm, Authorised Market Institution or an applicant for authorisation which does not satisfy the DFSA with respect to the location of its offices will, on this point alone not be considered fit and proper or able to satisfy the Licensing Requirements.

3.

The DFSA expects all Authorised Persons to have a physical presence, including Employees, in the DIFC. The DFSA does not permit ‘brass plate’ operations i.e. offices with the name of the entity but with no staff or where no meaningful activity takes place.

4.

The Companies Law, Limited Partnership Law and General Partnership Law of the DIFC also require entities to which they apply, to have a registered office in the DIFC, and to carry on their principal business activity in the DIFC.

(1) Where an Authorised Person or a Person who has submitted an application for authorisation to carry on one or more Financial Services has Close Links with another Person, the DFSA must be satisfied that those Close Links are not likely to prevent the effective supervision by the DFSA of the Authorised Person.

(2)

If requested by the DFSA the Authorised Person must submit a Close Links report or notification, in a form specified by the DFSA. This may be requested on an ad hoc or periodic basis.

Guidance

1.

Procedures for notification to the DFSA are set out in section 6.10.

2.

Under the fit and proper test for Authorised Firms and the Licensing Requirements for Authorised Market Institutions, an Authorised Firm or Authorised Market Institution which does not satisfy the DFSA with respect of its Close Links will, on this point alone, not be considered fit and proper or able to satisfy the Licensing Requirements.

6.7 Complaints against the DFSA

Guidance

1.

A Person who feels he has been adversely affected by the manner in which the DFSA has carried out its functions may make a complaint to the DFSA about its conduct or the conduct of its Employees.
