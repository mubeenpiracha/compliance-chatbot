In the case of Investments which are held in uncertificated or dematerialised form, the Person in whose name the rights to the relevant Investments are registered (by the central securities depository) is the holder and controller of the relevant Investments. Generally, the ‘PIN’ or other unique identifier of the owner of the Investments will be issued to the Person in whose name the dematerialised Investments are registered. Again, a firm that Provides Custody may appoint a Third Party Agent to hold and have access to them, in which case, the firm Providing Custody indirectly holds and controls those Investments, and remains accountable to the Client for the safe custody of those Investments. The firm must also comply with the Client Investments provisions in COB 6.13 and the Safe Custody Provisions in COB App6.
