c.

For a Token to be a Share we would generally expect the holder of that Token, as a person having a ‘share in the share capital’ of the legal entity, to have rights to participate in profits and benefits, assets in a winding up or voting rights, which are proportionate to the value of the share capital, represented by the tokens held or owned by the person. For example, if the legal entity has a share capital of $10 million, divided into Tokens of $100 each, each holder will have pro rata rights to distributions and voting rights, based on the number of tokens held.
