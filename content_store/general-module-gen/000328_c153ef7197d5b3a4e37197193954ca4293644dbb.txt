Guidance

1.

The purpose of the change management process is to ensure that changes and patches to production systems and hardware devices are adequately assessed, tested, approved and implemented.

2.

The DFSA expects an Authorised Person to establish a separate physical or logical environment for the development, testing and production of systems or patches. Moreover, the DFSA expects an Authorised Person to ensure a clear segregation of tasks so that no single individual develops, tests or implements any change.

3.

The DFSA recognises that, while any emergency change should be implemented in a controlled manner, the process requires swift actions and decisions. Therefore, some aspects of an Authorised Person’s change management process, such as change documentation or testing, can be completed after a change has been implemented, on an exceptional basis.

5.5.11 (1)

An Authorised Person must establish a process for the management of software updates that addresses security vulnerabilities in any of the Authorised Person’s ICT Assets.
