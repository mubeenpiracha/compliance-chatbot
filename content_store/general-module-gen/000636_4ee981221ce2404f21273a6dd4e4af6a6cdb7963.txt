a profit or incur a loss, based on the difference between the value of the FTSE 100 index on the opening day, and the closing day, of the contract. The contract is leveraged such that the profit or loss of A will be 5 times the amount of margin A posted with B to open the position. Under this contract, A’s and B’s right to a profit or loss will depend on whether the value of the FTSE 100 index moved up or down from the opening day to the closing day. If the rights conferred under that contract are represented by a Token issued by B, the Token confers rights and obligations substantially similar in nature to a contract falling within the definition of a Future at Rule A2.3.1(b)(ii). Therefore, the Token is a Derivative Token and is considered a Future.
