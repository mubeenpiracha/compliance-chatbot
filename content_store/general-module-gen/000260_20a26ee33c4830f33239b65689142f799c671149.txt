Guidance

1.

The term Employee is defined in the GLO widely and includes members of the Governing Body or directors and senior managers of the Authorised Firm. Therefore, the requirements relating to Employees in Rules 5.3.3 and 5.3.6 apply to all Employees including those across the organisation.

2.

The division of responsibilities between the Governing Body and the senior management should be clearly established and set out in writing. In assigning duties, the Governing Body should take care that no one individual has unfettered powers in making material decisions.
