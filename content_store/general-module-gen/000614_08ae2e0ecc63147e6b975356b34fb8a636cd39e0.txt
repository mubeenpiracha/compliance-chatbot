An Investment Token may confer rights and obligations that go beyond those conferred by one specific Security or Derivative and doing so will not prevent it from falling within the definition of an Investment Token, or from falling within the relevant category of Security or Derivative. Where an Investment Token confers rights and obligations that are substantially similar in nature to those conferred by more than one specific Security or Derivative, it may fall within more than one existing category of Security or Derivative (sometimes referred to as hybrid Investment Tokens) and be subject to the requirements under these Rules applicable to each of those categories.

When does a Token confer rights and obligations that are substantially similar in nature to those conferred by a specific Investment?
