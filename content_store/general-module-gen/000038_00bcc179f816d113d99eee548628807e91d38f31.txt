 the nature and scale of the activities, if a Person makes Financial Promotions on a regular basis or for a prolonged period while physically located in the DIFC, for example by way of a booth, meetings or conferences, the DFSA may consider such activities as constituting the carrying on of a Financial Service, such as Operating a Representative Office. The DFSA considers that in the context of Financial Promotions, “a regular basis” would be anything more than occasional and "a prolonged period" would usually be anything more than five consecutive days.
