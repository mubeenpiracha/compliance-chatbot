 that can be used only to pay for a particular service (such as a taxi or other transport service) or to pay for goods or services offered by a specific club or organisation. However, if a card is more generally accepted, and can be used with other third parties, it will not fall within the exclusion.

2. Where monetary value on a card or wallet can be used for a combination of purposes, all of that monetary value is likely to constitute Stored Value unless the issuer can demonstrate that there is a clear separation between amounts that can be used only for the issuerâ€™s goods and services and amounts that can be used for mixed purposes.

1.

The exclusion in Rule 2.7.4 is intended to apply, for example, to a Person who executes proprietary trades through a duly authorised broker, or to a Person who is carrying on a commercial business and enters into a transaction with a firm for a purpose related to that business, such as to hedge a risk. It does not apply to a Person that holds itself out as willing to enter into transactions relating to Investments or Crypto Tokens of that kind or as engaging in the business of dealing in Investments or Crypto Tokens, such as a market maker or an online trading platform operator (even if it enters into transactions only with Authorised Firms or Regulated Financial Institutions).

A Person may hold itself out as carrying on an activity by various means including, for example, on its webpage, in an advertisement or through representations made by its staff. However, merely placing orders with a broker or on a market will not amount to holding out.

Principal if in the course of managing the assets of a Private Equity Fund:
