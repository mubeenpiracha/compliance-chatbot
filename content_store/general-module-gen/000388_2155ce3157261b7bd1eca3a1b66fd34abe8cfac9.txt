Guidance

1.

In appropriate circumstances, the DFSA may waive the requirement for a Compliance Officer or MLRO to be resident in the UAE. In determining whether to grant a waiver, the DFSA will consider a range of factors on a case by case basis focused on whether the firm can demonstrate that it has appropriate compliance arrangements (see GEN section 5.3). These factors may include, but are not limited to: the nature, scale and complexity of the activities of the firm; the ability of a remote officer to carry out his functions in differing time zones and a differing working week; the size, resourcing and capabilities of a remote compliance function; the ability of a remote officer to liaise and communicate readily with the DFSA; and the competency and capability of a remote officer and whether the remote officer is able effectively to undertake or supervise regular compliance monitoring and keep up to date with applicable Rules.

2.

The DFSA will also take into account factors such as the relevant regulatory experience of the proposed Authorised Individual and whether the applicant firm has previously been subject to financial services regulation.
