A Person intending to acquire or increase control in an Authorised Firm should submit an application for approval in the appropriate form in AFN sufficiently in advance of the proposed acquisition to be able to obtain the DFSA approval in time for the proposed acquisition. Sections 3-2-34 â€“ 3-2-37 of the RPP Sourcebook set out the matters which the DFSA will take into consideration when exercising its powers under Rule 11.8.5 to approve, object to or impose conditions of approval relating to a proposed Controller or a proposed increase in the level of control of an existing Controller.
