Guidance

Activities that constitute ‘Arranging Credit’

1.

Generally, the following activities constitute Arranging Credit:

a.

Introducing potential borrowers to a credit provider (who can be in the DIFC or outside the DIFC);

b.

Assisting a potential borrower to obtain credit, such as completing application forms and other processes relevant to the transaction;

c.

Negotiating terms of credit, including any fees payable to the arranger; and

d.

Arranging collateral or other assurances needed by the potential borrower to obtain credit.

2.

The Guidance under ‘Arranging Deals in Investments’ is generally relevant for ‘Arranging Credit’, although the activities relate to ‘credit’ in this context, instead of ‘Investments’. Therefore, a reference to Investment in that Guidance should be read as ‘credit’ for the purposes of ‘Arranging Credit’.
