Guidance

See Rules 11.8.2 and 11.8.3 for the circumstances in which a Person becomes a Controller of an Authorised Person.

Approval process

(1)

A Person who is required to obtain the prior written approval of the DFSA pursuant to Rule 11.8.4(1) must make an application to the DFSA using the appropriate form in AFN.

(2) Where the DFSA receives an application under (1), it may:

(a)

approve the proposed acquisition or increase in the level of control;

(b)

approve the proposed acquisition or increase in the level of control subject to such conditions as it considers appropriate; or

(c)

object to the proposed acquisition or increase in the level of control.

Guidance

1.

A Person intending to acquire or increase control in an Authorised Firm should submit an application for approval in the appropriate form in AFN sufficiently in advance of the proposed acquisition to be able to obtain the DFSA approval in time for the proposed acquisition. Sections 3-2-34 – 3-2-37 of the RPP Sourcebook set out the matters which the DFSA will take into consideration when exercising its powers under Rule 11.8.5 to approve, object to or impose conditions of approval relating to a proposed Controller or a proposed increase in the level of control of an existing Controller.

2.

The DFSA will exercise its powers relating to Controllers in a manner proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of an Authorised Firm’s business, and the impact a proposed change in control would have on that firm and its Clients. For example, the DFSA would generally be less likely to impose conditions requiring a proposed acquirer of control of an Authorised Firm whose financial failure would have a limited systemic impact or impact on its Clients to provide prudential support to the firm by contributing more capital. Most advisory and arranging firms will fall into this class.

(1) Where the DFSA proposes to approve a proposed acquisition or an increase in the level of control in an Authorised Firm pursuant to Rule 11.8.5(2)(a), it must:

(a)

do so as soon as practicable and in any event within 90 days of the receipt of a duly completed application, unless a different period is considered appropriate by the DFSA and notified to the applicant in writing; and

(b)

issue to the applicant, and where appropriate to the Authorised Firm, an approval notice as soon as practicable after making that decision.

(2)

An approval, including a conditional approval granted by the DFSA pursuant to
