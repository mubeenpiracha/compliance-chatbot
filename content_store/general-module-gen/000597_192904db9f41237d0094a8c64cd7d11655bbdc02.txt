Severance payments

9.

Where an Authorised Person provides discretionary payouts on termination of employment (“severance payments”, also called “golden parachutes”), such payment should generally be subject to appropriate limits or shareholder approval. In any case, such payouts should be aligned with the firm’s overall financial condition and performance over an appropriate time horizon and should not be payable in the case of failure or threatened failure of the firm, particularly to an individual whose actions may have contributed to the failure or potential failure of the firm.
