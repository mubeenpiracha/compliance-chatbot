How does Providing Custody differ from Arranging Custody?

2.

The Financial Service of Providing Custody differs from that of Arranging Custody because:

a. a Person Providing Custody is legally accountable to Clients for safeguarding and administering Client Investments or Crypto Tokens (which are defined as Client Assets – see the GLO definition), even if it appoints a Third Party Agent (see GLO) to hold Client Investments or Crypto Tokens; and

b. a Person arranging Custody does not become a party to the arrangement to Provide Custody and hence does not assume any duties or responsibilities to the Client for the safe custody of the Client’s Investments or Crypto Tokens – instead, such a Person merely facilitates a custodian to provide its services to a potential user of its services.
