Guidance

1.

The DFSA expects that an Authorised Person’s strong password controls require, at the minimum, a change of password upon initial logon, minimum password length and history requirements, password complexity, maximum validity periods as well as lockout thresholds after a number of unsuccessful logon attempts.

2.

For mobile devices, access controls and encryption techniques should address threats raised by their use outside the Authorised Person’s premises.

5.5.10 (1)

An Authorised Person must have a comprehensive change management process that considers Cyber Risk before and during a change to its IT Systems and Networks and any new Cyber Risk created after the change.

(2)

The process in (1) must include systems and controls that ensure changes to its IT System and Networks are:

(a) adequately tested;

(b) approved before their implementation; and

(c)

implemented quickly if needed to resolve major Cyber Incidents or security vulnerabilities.
