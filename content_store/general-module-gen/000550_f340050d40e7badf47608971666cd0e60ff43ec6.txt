Guidance

1.

A Debenture may include a bond, debenture stock, loan stock or note. Certain Islamic products (“Sukuk”) structured as a debt instrument can also fall within this definition.

2.

If the interest or financial return component on a debt instrument is to be calculated by reference to fluctuations of an external factor such as an index, exchange rate or interest rate, that does not prevent such an instrument being characterised as a Debenture.
