Existing Authorised Persons that wish to test innovative technology

26.

If an existing Authorised Person wishes to test innovative technology, it will not need to apply for a Licence. Instead, if it has authorisation for the activity it wishes to carry on, it may carry on the activity. Alternatively, if it does not have the relevant authorisation for the activity, it will need to apply to amend its Licence to obtain that authorisation.

27.

If the Authorised Person considers that there are Rules that are not appropriate or are disproportionate to the testing of its technology, it can apply to the DFSA for a waiver or modification of the Rules. Again, if the DFSA grants waivers or modifications, it will do so only for a finite period (the period during which testing is to take place).

28.

An Authorised Person that wishes to test an innovative technology should discuss its proposal with the DFSA at an early stage.
