 Crypto Tokens that would be an OTF if the definition in (3) applied to Crypto Tokens.

Guidance

The main distinction between operating an MTF and operating an OTF is that the former is operated in accordance with the non-discretionary rules adopted and implemented by the operator, whereas the latter is operated in accordance with the discretionary rules of the operator. Accordingly, a Person operating an OTF has more flexibility relating to how it applies its rules to participants on its facility, whereas a Person operating an MTF is required to apply its rules in a non-discretionary manner across all participants on its facility. Under the above Rule, an OTF cannot be operated for Crypto Tokens. Therefore, an ATS relating to Crypto Tokens may only be a MTF.
