Guidance

The purpose of the non-cellular capital adjustment is to permit an Insurer to allocate all or part of its Adjusted Non-Cellular Capital Resources to support the Adjusted Cellular Capital Resources of its Cells. The adjustment is limited to the amount of Adjusted Non-Cellular Capital Resources that could be made available to meet Cellular Liabilities.

A5.9.2 The amount of the non-cellular capital adjustment in respect of a Cell is an amount

selected by the Insurer, subject to the following constraints:

(a)

the non-cellular capital adjustment in respect of a Cell must not be negative; and

(b)

the sum of the non-cellular capital adjustments in respect of all Cells must not exceed the amount that could be made available to meet the Cellular Liabilities in the event of insolvency of the Insurer, after taking into consideration all other potential calls on the Insurer's Adjusted Non-Cellular Capital Resources.
