APP8 CALCULATION OF MINIMUM FUND CAPITAL REQUIREMENT

A8.1 Purpose and general provisions

A8.1.1 This appendix applies to all Insurers to which Rule 4.5 applies.

Guidance

1.

This appendix sets out the manner in which an Insurer that conducts Long-Term Insurance Business through a Long-Term Insurance Fund is required to calculate the Minimum Fund Capital Requirement in respect of each Long-Term Insurance Fund.

2.

The Minimum Fund Capital Requirement is calculated on a basis that is analogous to the basis of calculation of the Minimum Capital Requirement for Insurers other than Cell Companies, as set out in APP4.

3.

The effect therefore is as though each Long-Term Insurance Fund maintained by an Insurer were itself an Insurer that had to calculate a Minimum Capital Requirement Consequently, this appendix incorporates references to the provisions of APP4.
