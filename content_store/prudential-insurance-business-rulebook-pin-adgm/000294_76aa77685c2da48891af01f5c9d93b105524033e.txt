A5.5.2 Hybrid non-cellular capital excludes any instrument that is attributable to a Cell.

A5.5.3 Subject to Rule A5.5.4, an Insurer must calculate its hybrid non-cellular capital adjustment as the amount by which the total amount of hybrid non-cellular capital exceeds 15% of adjusted non-cellular equity.

A5.5.4 The Regulator may at its discretion and on the application of an Insurer, permit that Insurer to apply Rule A5.5.3 as though the figure of 15% was replaced with a higher figure approved in writing by the Regulator. The approved figure may not be more than the actual percentage which the hybrid non-cellular capital represents of adjusted non-cellular equity, and may not in any case exceed 30%.
