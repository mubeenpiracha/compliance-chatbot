A7.2 Adjusted Fund Capital Resources

A7.2.1 An Insurer must calculate the Adjusted Fund Capital Resources in respect of each

Long-Term Insurance Fund maintained by it, according to the formula:

AFCR = AFE â€“ FHCA

where:

AFCR means the Adjusted Fund Capital Resources in respect of the fund;

AFE means the adjusted fund equity in respect of that fund; and

FHCA means the fund hybrid capital adjustment in respect of that fund.

A7.2.2 Adjusted fund equity is calculated as set out in Rule A7.4. The fund hybrid capital

adjustment is set out in Rule A7.5.
