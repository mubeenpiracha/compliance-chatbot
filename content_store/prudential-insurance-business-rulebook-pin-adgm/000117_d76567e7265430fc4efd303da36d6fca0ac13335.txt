Where the business of the Insurer includes participating Long-Term Insurance Business, it will be necessary for the determination of surplus at Rule 7.3.6(h) for the decision on allocation of bonuses to be dealt separately from the surplus for the purposes of determining the capital adequacy of the Fund. For the former of these two purposes, the Insurer is identifying the pool, commonly known as surplus, that is available for allocation as bonuses (or equivalent) on participating policies. The allocation then reduces the surplus (by convention, this is treated as occurring at the reporting date). By contrast, for the latter of the two purposes, that portion of the remaining surplus that is expected to be allocated eventually to policyholders is also treated as a liability (in Rule 5.6.7), on the grounds that it is not available to absorb losses of the Insurer. For that purpose, declaration of bonuses merely represents a transfer from one recognised liability to another.
