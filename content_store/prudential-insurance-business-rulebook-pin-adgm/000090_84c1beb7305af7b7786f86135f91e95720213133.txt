For the purposes of Rule 5.6.7(f), an Insurer should ensure that yields used to determine the discount rate are adjusted to take account of the risk that yields will decrease. High yields that represent compensation for risks such as credit or currency risk should be adjusted down to account for those elements of the yield.
