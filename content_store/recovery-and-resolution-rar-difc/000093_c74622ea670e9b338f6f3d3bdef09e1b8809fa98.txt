In exceptional circumstances, where the Bail-in Tool is applied, the DFSA may exclude or partially exclude certain liabilities from the application of the Write Down or Conversion Power where:

(a)

it is not possible to bail-in that liability within a reasonable time despite the reasonable efforts of the DFSA;

(b)

the exclusion is strictly necessary and is proportionate to meet the Resolution Objectives;

(c)

the exclusion is strictly necessary and proportionate to avoid giving rise to widespread contagion, which will severely disrupt the functioning of financial markets, including financial market infrastructures, in a manner that could cause broader financial instability; or

(d)

the application of the Bail-in Tool to those liabilities will cause a destruction of value such that the losses borne by other creditors will be higher than if those liabilities were excluded from bail-in.
