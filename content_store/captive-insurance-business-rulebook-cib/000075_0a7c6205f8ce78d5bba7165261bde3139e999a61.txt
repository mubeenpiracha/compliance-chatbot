6.9.4 The best estimate calculated by a Captive Insurer must correspond to the probability- weighted average of future cash-flows under the Captive Insurer's insurance and contracts of reinsurance, taking account of the time value of money using the relevant discount rate applying pursuant to Rule 6.12.

6.9.5 A Captive Insurer must calculate the best estimate:

(a)

based upon up-to-date and credible information and realistic assumptions and using adequate, applicable and relevant actuarial and statistical methods;

(b)

taking account of all the cash in- and out-flows required to settle the obligations arising under the Insurer's insurance and contracts of reinsurance; and

(c)

gross, without deduction of the amounts recoverable from contracts of reinsurance entered into by the Captive Insurer as Cedant.

6.9.6 A Captive Insurer must calculate the risk margin so as to ensure that the value of the technical provisions is equivalent to the amount that another entity would be expected to require in order to take over and meet the obligations arising under the Captive Insurer's insurance and contracts of reinsurance.
