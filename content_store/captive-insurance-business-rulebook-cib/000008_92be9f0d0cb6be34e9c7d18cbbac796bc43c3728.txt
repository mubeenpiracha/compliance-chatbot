(a)

where an item of numerical information in respect of a Class of Business for a type of insurance contract is less than 2% of the total such numerical information in respect of all Classes of Business for that type of insurance contract, the Captive Insurer may aggregate that numerical information for that Class of Business for that type of insurance contract with the same item of information for the Class of Business for that type of contract in which that item of information is the largest; and
