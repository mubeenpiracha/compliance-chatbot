Definitions

Means the low estimate scenario of Petroleum Reserves. It is equivalent to Proved Reserves.

has the meaning of the term or equivalent term in the PRMS.

Means the best estimate scenario of Petroleum Reserves. It is equivalent to the sum of Proved Reserves plus Probable Reserves.

Means the best estimate of the quantity that will actually be recovered from an accumulation by a Petroleum Project. It is the most realistic assessment of recoverable quantities if only a single result were reported. When Probabilistic Methods are used, there should be at least a 50% probability (P50) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed 2P.

Means the high estimate scenario of Petroleum Reserves. It is equivalent to the sum of Proved Reserves plus Probable Reserves plus Possible Reserves.

Means an optimistic estimate of the quantity that will actually be recovered from an accumulation by a Petroleum Project. When Probabilistic Methods are used, there should be at least a 10% probability (P10) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed 3U.
