Guidance

When assessing whether it has appropriate rules, procedures and surveillance practices in place, a Recognised Body should consider the extent to which its rules, procedures and arrangements for monitoring and overseeing the use of its facilities:

(a)

include appropriate measures to prevent the use of its facilities for abusive or improper purposes;

(b)

provide appropriate safeguards for investors against fraud or misconduct, recklessness, negligence or incompetence by users of its facilities;

(c)

provide appropriate information to enable users of its facilities to monitor their use of the facilities;

(d)

include appropriate arrangements to enable users of its facilities to raise queries about any use of those facilities which they are reported to have made;

(e)

include appropriate arrangements to enable users of its facilities to comply with any relevant regulatory or legal requirements; and

(f)

include appropriate arrangements to reduce the risk that those facilities will be used in ways which are incompatible with relevant regulatory or legal requirements,
