Form of notification

5.2.1

Where a Recognised Body is required to give any notice or information under any notification rule, it may do so (unless that rule expressly provides otherwise) orally or in writing, whichever is the more appropriate in the circumstances, but where it gives notice or information orally, it must confirm that notice or information in writing promptly.
