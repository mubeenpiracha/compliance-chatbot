If a Person who performs a function on behalf of a Recognised Body is himself carrying on a Regulated Activity in ADGM, he will, unless he is a Person to whom the General Prohibition does not apply, need to be either an Authorised Person or an Exempt Person. The Person to whom a function is delegated is not covered by the Recognised Body's exemption.

2.

Where a Recognised Body makes arrangements under Rule 2.14, these arrangements do not alter the responsibility of Recognised Body to meet and satisfy the Recognition Requirements.
