6.6

Power to give directions

6.6.1

The Regulator has the power under sections 132 and 133 of FSMR to give directions to a Recognised Body to take specified steps in order to secure its compliance with the Recognition Requirements. Those steps may include granting the Regulator access to the Recognised Body's premises for the purposes of inspecting those premises or any documents on the premises and the suspension of the carrying on of any activity by the Recognised Body for the period specified in the direction.

6.6.2

The Regulator is likely to exercise this power if it considers that:

(a)

there has been, or was likely to be, a failure to satisfy one or more of the Recognition Requirements which has serious consequences;

(b)

compliance with the direction would ensure that one or more of the Recognition Requirements is satisfied; and

(c)

the Recognised Body is capable of complying with the direction.

6.6.3

The Regulator need not follow the consultation procedure set out in Rule 6.9 or may cut short that procedure, if it considers it reasonably necessary to do so.
