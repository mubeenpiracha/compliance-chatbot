6.4.2

The Regulator is required to have arrangements to investigate complaints which it considers relevant to the question of whether a Recognised Body should remain recognised as such. This section describes aspects of the Regulator's arrangements for investigating relevant complaints.

6.4.3

Where the Regulator receives a complaint about a Recognised Body, it will, in the first instance, seek to establish whether the complainant has approached the Recognised Body. Where this is not the case, the Regulator will ask the complainant to complain to the Recognised Body. Where the complainant is dissatisfied with the handling of the complaint, but has not exhausted the Recognised Body's own internal complaints procedures (in the case of a complaint against a Recognised Body, including by applying to that body's complaints investigator), the Regulator will encourage the complainant to do so.
