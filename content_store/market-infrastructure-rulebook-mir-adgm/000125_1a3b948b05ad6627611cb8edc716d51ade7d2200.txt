Waivers based on market model and type of order or transaction

3.5.7

Waivers from Rule 3.5.1 based on market model and transaction may be granted by the Regulator in respect of Financial Instruments, for any of the following:

(a)

systems matching orders based on a trading methodology by which the price of the Financial Instrument is derived from a reference price generated by another trading venue or the most relevant market in terms of liquidity, where that reference price is widely published and is regarded by Members as a reliable reference price;

(b)

systems that formalise negotiated transactions, which are:

made at, or within, the current volume weighted spread reflected on the order book or the quotes of the market makers, subject to a volume cap to be determined by the Regulator to ensure that the use of this waiver does not unduly harm price formation;
