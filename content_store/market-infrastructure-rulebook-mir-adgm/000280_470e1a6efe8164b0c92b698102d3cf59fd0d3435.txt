The Regulator may issue a "positive" direction (to take action) where in any case a Recognised Body has not taken action under its Default Rules, but it appears to the Regulator that the Recognised Body could take action.

6.5.5

Before giving such a direction under Rule 6.5.4, the Regulator shall consult the Recognised Body in question, and the Regulator shall not give a direction unless the Regulator is satisfied, in the light of that consultation that:

failure to take action would involve undue risk to investors or other participants in the market;

(b)

the direction is necessary having regard to the public interest in the financial stability of ADGM; or

(c)

the direction is necessary to facilitate a proposed or possible use of a power under chapter 16 of COBS or in connection with a particular exercise of a power under that chapter, or Rule 6.5.7(c).

6.5.6

The Regulator may issue a "negative" direction (not to take action) where in any case a Recognised Body has not taken action under its Default Rules, but it appears to the Regulator that the Recognised Body is proposing to take or may take action.
