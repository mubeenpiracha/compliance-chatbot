Conflicts of interest

2.

When assessing its systems and controls in relation to conflicts of interest, a Recognised Body should have regard to the following:

(a)

A conflict of interest arises in a situation where a Person with responsibility to act in the interests of one Person may be influenced in his action by an interest or association of his own, whether Personal or business or employment related. Conflicts of interest can arise both for the Employees of Recognised Bodies and for the members (or other Persons) who may be involved in the decision- making process, for example where they belong to committees or to the Governing Body.
