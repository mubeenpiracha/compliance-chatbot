Guidance

1. Where an application concerns activities relating to Spot Commodities that will be undertaken by a Recognised Body, whether a Recognised Investment Exchange or Recognised Clearing House, the fees in Section 4.1 will apply.

2. Depending on the complexity and risks inherent in an Applicant’s business model, the Regulator, when considering an application in relation to Virtual Assets, may decide to apply the relevant fees relating to specific Regulated Activities and Virtual Assets cumulatively in certain circumstances. Applicants are directed to review the discussion of factors relating to the calculation of fees for Virtual Asset related business models contained in the Regulator’s “Guidance - Regulation of Virtual Asset Activities in ADGM”.
