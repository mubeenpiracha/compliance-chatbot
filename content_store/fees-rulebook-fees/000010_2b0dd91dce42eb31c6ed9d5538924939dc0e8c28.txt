Guidance

Where a Regulatory Filing is submitted after the date on which it becomes due, the Authorised Person, Designated Non-Financial Business or Profession or a Recognised Body is in breach of a Rule. In addition to the imposition of a fee under Rule 1.2.7, the Regulator may take further action.

For Designated Non-Financial Businesses or Professions, Rule 1.2.7 relates to the AML Return, as required by Rule 4.6.1 in the Anti-Money Laundering and Sanctions Rules and Guidance Rulebook.

1.2.8 Relief from Payment

The Regulator may at any time reduce, waive or refund all or part of any fee including any supplementary or late payment fee if it considers that, in the circumstances of a particular case, it would be fair and reasonable to do so.
