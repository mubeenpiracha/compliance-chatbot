 of an Authorised Person which has issued the Fiat-Referenced Token.

Guidance

1. Principle 9 of the Principles for Authorised Persons (Customer assets and money) in GEN 2.2.9 requires an Authorised Person to arrange proper protection for Clients' Assets, including Client Money and Relevant Money where the Authorised Person is responsible for them. An essential part of that protection is that an Authorised Person must properly safeguard Client Money held or controlled on behalf of a Client in the course of, or in connection with, the carrying on of Investment Business, or properly safeguard Relevant Money held in the course of the delivery of Payment Services.

2. An Authorised Person must introduce adequate organisational arrangements to minimise the risk of the loss or diminution of Client Money and Relevant Money as a result of, for example, the Authorised Person's or a third party's insolvency, fraud, poor administration, inadequate recordkeeping or negligence.

3. An Authorised Person that holds or controls Client Investments, Provides Custody or Arranges Custody must also comply with Chapter 15.

4. A Fund Manager, Fund Administrator, Custodian or Trustee that holds Fund Property must comply with the Fund Rules rather than the Client Money Rules.

5. An Authorised Person in Category 4, other than an Authorised Person engaged in the Regulated Activity of Operating a Private Financing Platform, must not hold or control Client Money.

14.2 General Requirements

14.2.1 An Authorised Person which holds or controls Client Money must comply with, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, the Client Money Rules in relation to that Client Money and have systems and controls in place to ensure that Client Money is identifiable and secure at all times.

14.2.2 Where the Client is a Professional Client which is a Market Counterparty, an Authorised Person engaging in Investment Business may exclude the application of the Client Money Rules but only where it has obtained the prior written consent of the Client to do so.
