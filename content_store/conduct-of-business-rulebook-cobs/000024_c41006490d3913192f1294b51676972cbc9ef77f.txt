 An Authorised Person must also have adequate procedures and controls when it prepares or publishes Investment Research, in accordance with GEN 3.3 and COBS 3.5.

6.4.4 Restrictions on Publication

If an Authorised Person acts as a manager or co-manager of an initial public offering or a secondary offering, it must take reasonable steps to ensure that:

(i)

it does not publish Investment Research relating to the Investment during a Quiet Period; and

(ii)

an Investment Analyst from the Authorised Person does not make a public appearance relating to that Investment during a Quiet Period.

Guidance

The same conflicts of interest mentioned in this section do not arise if an Investment Analyst prepares Investment Research solely for an Authorised Person's own use and not for publication. For example, if the research material is prepared solely for the purposes of the Authorised Person's proprietary trading then the use of this information would fall outside the restrictions placed on publications.

6.4.5 Restriction on Own Account Transactions

(a)

An Authorised Person or its Associate must not knowingly execute a Transaction for its own account in an Investment or related Investments, which is the subject of Investment Research, prepared either by the Authorised Person or its Associate, until the Clients for whom the Investment Research was principally intended have had a reasonable opportunity to act upon it.

(b)

The restriction in Rule 6.4.5(a) does not apply if:

(i)

the Authorised Person or its Associate is a Market Maker in the relevant Investment;

(ii)

the Authorised Person or its Associate undertakes an Execution-Only Transaction for a Client; or

(iii)

it is not expected to materially affect the price of the Investment.

Guidance

The exceptions in Rule 6.4.5(b) allow an Authorised Person to continue to provide key services to the market and to its Clients even if the Authorised Person would be considered to have knowledge of the timing and content of the Investment Research which is intended for publication to Clients, for example when it is impractical for an Authorised Person to put in place an information barrier because the Authorised Person has few Employees or cannot otherwise separate its functions.

6.4.6 Offers of Securities

When an Authorised Person carries out a mandate to manage an Offer of Securities, it must implement adequate internal arrangements, in accordance with Rule 3.5, to manage any conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of the Authorised Person's duty to two distinct sets of Clients namely the corporate finance Client and the investment Client. An Authorised Personâ€™s primary duty in relation to the pricing of any Offer of or for Securities in the context of Corporate Finance Business is to its corporate finance Client.

6.4.7 Disclosure

(a)

When an Authorised Person accepts a mandate to manage an Offer, it must take reasonable steps to disclose to its corporate finance Client:

(i)

the process the Authorised Person proposes to adopt in order to determine what recommendations it will make about allocations for the Offer;

(ii)

details of how the target investor group, to whom it is planned to Offer the Securities, will be identified;

(iii)

the process through which recommendations are prepared and by whom; and

(iv)

(if relevant) that it may recommend placing Securities with a Client of the Authorised Person for whom the Authorised Person provides other services, with the Authorised Person's own proprietary book, or with an Associate, and that this represents a potential conflict of interest.

Guidance

It is the Regulator's expectation that an Authorised Person's procedures to identify and manage conflicts of interest should extend to the allocation process for an offering of Securities.
