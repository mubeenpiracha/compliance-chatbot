Guidance

1. Chapter 12 sets out the core information that must be included in every Client Agreement and additional disclosure for certain types of activities to which this chapter applies.

2. An Authorised Person may either provide a Person with a copy of the proposed Client Agreement, or give that information in a separate form. If there are any changes to the terms and conditions of the proposed agreement, the Authorised Person must ensure that the Client Agreement to be signed with the Person accurately incorporates those changes.

3. An Authorised Person may consider it is reasonably impracticable to provide the key information to a Person if that Person requests the Authorised Person to execute a Transaction on a time critical basis. Where an Authorised Person has explained why it is impracticable to comply with the requirement to enter into a Client Agreement orally, it must maintain records to demonstrate to the Regulator that it has provided that information to the Client.
