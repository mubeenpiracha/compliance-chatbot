 Investment Analysts;

(ii)

that the actual or potential conflicts of interest are proactively managed in accordance with Rule 3.5;

(iii)

that the Investment Research issued to Clients is impartial; and

(iv)

that the Investment Research contains the disclosures described under Rules 6.4.3 and 6.4.5.

(b)

An Authorised Person's procedures, controls and internal arrangements, which may include Information Barriers, should limit the extent of Investment Analysts' participation in Corporate Finance Business and sales and trading activities, and ensure remuneration structures do not affect their independence.

Guidance

Investment Research is seen as a significant potential source of conflicts of interest within an Authorised Person and therefore an Authorised Person preparing or publishing investment research must have adequate procedures, systems and controls to manage effectively and conflicts that arise.

6.4.3 Disclosures in Investment Research

(a)

When an Authorised Person publishes Investment Research, it must take reasonable steps to ensure that the Investment Research:

(i)

clearly identifies the types of Clients for whom it is principally intended;

(ii)

distinguishes fact from opinion or estimates, and includes references to sources of data and any assumptions used;

(iii)

specifies the date when it was first published;

(iv)

specifies the period the ratings or recommendations are intended to cover;

(v)

contains a clear and unambiguous explanation of the rating or recommendation system used;

37

COBS VER19.290725

(vi)

includes a distribution of the different ratings or recommendations, in percentage terms:

(A)

for all Investments;

(B)

for Investments in each sector covered; and

(C)

for Investments, if any, where the Authorised Person has undertaken Corporate Finance Business with or for the Issuer over the past twelve months; and

(vii)

if intended for use only by a Professional Client, contains a clear warning that it should not be relied upon by or distributed to Retail Clients.

(b)

An Authorised Person must consider whether it would be appropriate to include a price chart or line graph depicting the performance of the Investment for the period that the Authorised Person has assigned a rating or recommendation for that investment, including any dates on which the ratings were revised.

(c)

For the purposes of this section, an Authorised Person must take reasonable steps to ensure that when it publishes Investment Research, and in the case where a representative of the Authorised Person makes a public appearance, disclosure is made of the following matters:

(i)

any financial interest or material interest that the Investment Analyst or a Close Relative of the analyst has, which relates to the Investment;

(ii)

the reporting lines for Investment Analysts and their remuneration arrangements where such matters give rise to any conflicts of interest which may reasonably be likely to impair the impartiality of the Investment Research;

(iii)

any shareholding by the Authorised Person or its Associate of 1% or more of the total issued share capital of the Issuer;

(iv)

if the Authorised Person or its Associate acts as corporate broker for the Issuer;

(v)

any material shareholding by the Issuer in the Authorised Person;

(vi)

any Corporate Finance Business undertaken by the Authorised Person with or for the Issuer over the past twelve months, and any future relevant Corporate Finance Business initiatives; and

(vii)

that the Authorised Person is a Market Maker in the Investment, if that is the case.

Guidance

The requirements in this Rule 6.4.3 apply to an Authorised Person in addition to other requirements under FSMR and any rules made thereunder. For example, an Authorised

38

COBS VER19.290725

Person is required to take reasonable steps to identify actual or potential conflicts of interest and then prevent or manage them under GEN 3.3.21-3.3.24. An Authorised Person must also have adequate procedures and controls when it prepares or publishes Investment Research, in accordance with GEN 3.3 and COBS 3.5.

6.4.4 Restrictions on Publication

If an Authorised Person acts as a manager or co-manager of an initial public offering or a secondary offering, it must take reasonable steps to ensure that:

(i)

it does not publish Investment Research relating to the Investment during a Quiet Period; and

(ii)

an Investment Analyst from the Authorised Person does not make a public appearance relating to that Investment during a Quiet Period.
