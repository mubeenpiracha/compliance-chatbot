 Person must include, where applicable, consideration of the following matters:

(i)

the Person’s knowledge and understanding of the relevant financial markets, types of financial products or arrangements and the risks involved either generally or in relation to a proposed Transaction;

(ii)

the length of time the Person has participated in relevant financial markets, the frequency of dealings and the extent to which the Person has relied on professional financial advice;

(iii)

the size and nature of transactions that have been undertaken by, or on behalf of, the Person in relevant financial markets;

(iv)

the Person’s relevant qualifications relating to financial markets;

(v)

the composition and size of the Person’s existing financial investment portfolio;

(vi)

in the case of credit or insurance transactions, relevant experience in relation to similar transactions to be able to understand the risks associated with such transactions; and

(vii)

any other matters which the Authorised Person considers relevant.

(b)

Where the analysis is being carried out in respect of an Undertaking, the analysis must be applied to those individuals, officers or directos who are authorised to undertake transactions on behalf of the Undertaking.

2.6.3 Reliance on a classification made elsewhere

(a)

An Authorised Person may rely on a client classification made, if it is a Branch, by its head office or any other branch of the same legal entity, or if it is a member of a Group, by any other member of its Group, if it has reasonable grounds to believe that such a client classification is substantially similar to the client classification required under these Rules and such client classification was undertaken in consideration of the Regulated Activity and associated product or service which the Authorised Person intends to provide.

(b)

If any gaps are identified between the requirements applicable to the Authorised Person under these Rules and the requirements under which the client classification is carried out by such other entity, the Authorised Person may rely on such a client classification only if it has effectively addressed the identified gaps.

Guidance

1.

Generally, an Authorised Person relying on this Rule should be able to demonstrate to the Regulator the due diligence process that it had undertaken to assess whether the client classification made by its head office or other branch of the same legal entity or a member of its Group substantially meets the client classification requirements in these Rules (e.g. documents verified and available) and, if any gaps are identified, how those gaps are effectively addressed.

2.

If an Authorised Person wishes to use any client classification undertaken by any third party other than its head office or another branch of the same legal entity, or a member of its Group, such an arrangement is generally treated as an outsourcing arrangement. In such case, the Authorised Person would need to meet the requirements in GEN 3.3.32 relating to outsourcing.

2.6.4 Group clients

An Authorised Person that is a member of a Group and carries out one or more Regulated Activities where the Regulated Activities carried out by the Authorised Person form part of a bundle of Regulated Activities carried out for the benefit of that Client by Group members of the Authorised Person must ensure that:

(i)

the client classification it adopts for any Regulated Activity carried on which involves the provision of a service to a Client is both consistent with the requirements in these Rules and appropriate for the overall bundle of Regulated Activities which involve the provision of services to a Client;

(ii)

the Client has a clear understanding of the arrangement under which Regulated Activities are carried out for the Client’s benefit by the Authorised Person in conjunction with the other members of the Group; and

(iii)

any risks arising from such arrangements are identified and appropriately and effectively addressed.

Guidance

1.

Different entities in a Group may have different arrangements under which they provide to their Clients one or more Regulated Activities. Such arrangements may involve, instead of each member within a Group carrying on a discrete stand- alone Regulated Activity, different members of the Group carrying on different aspects of the bundle of Regulated Activities carried on for the Client’s benefit. An example is where a number of members within a Group provide discrete aspects of expertise that facilitate merger and acquisition activity of a Client. In such a situation, different members of the Group could prepare and provide:
