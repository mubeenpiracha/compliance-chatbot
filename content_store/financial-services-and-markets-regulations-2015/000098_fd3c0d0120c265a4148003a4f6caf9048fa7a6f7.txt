(b)

in the opinion of the Regulator, is prejudicial to the Third Party;

a copy of the notice must be given to the Third Party.

(2)

Subsection (1) does not require a copy to be given to the Third Party if the Regulator—

(a)

has given him a separate warning notice in relation to the same matter; or

gives him such a notice at the same time as it gives the warning notice which identifies him.

The notice copied to a Third Party under subsection (1) must specify a reasonable period within which he may make representations to the Regulator.
