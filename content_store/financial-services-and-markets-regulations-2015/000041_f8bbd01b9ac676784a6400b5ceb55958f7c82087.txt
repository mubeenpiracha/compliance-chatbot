An Application by a Remote Body Applicant must comply with such requirements (the “Remote Recognition Requirements”) relating to Remote Bodies as the Regulator may specify by Rules.

If it appears to the Regulator that a Remote Body Applicant satisfies the requirements of subsection (3) it may make a Recognition Order declaring the Applicant to be—

(a)

a Remote Investment Exchange;

(b)

a Remote Clearing House.

The requirements are that—

investors are afforded protection equivalent to that which they would be afforded if the body concerned were required to comply with Recognition Requirements, other than any such requirements which are expressed in Rules under section 120 not to apply for the purposes of this paragraph;

(b)

there are adequate procedures for dealing with a person who is unable, or likely to become unable, to meet his obligations in respect of one or more Market Contracts connected with the investment exchange or clearing house;

(d)

adequate arrangements exist for co-operation between the Regulator and those responsible for the supervision of the Applicant in the country or territory in which the Applicant's head office is situated.

(b)

the rules and practices of the Applicant.

In relation to a Remote Body Applicant and a body or association declared to be a Remote Investment Exchange or Remote Clearing House by a Recognition Order made by virtue of subsection (2)—

(a)

the reference in section 139(1) to Recognition Requirements is to be read as a reference to Remote Recognition Requirements;

(b)

sections 132(1) and 134(2) have effect as if the requirements mentioned in section 132(1)(a) and section 134(2)(a) were those of subsections (3)(a), (b), and (c) of this section;

(c)

section 134(2) has effect as if the grounds on which a Recognition Order may be revoked under that provision included the ground that in the opinion of the
