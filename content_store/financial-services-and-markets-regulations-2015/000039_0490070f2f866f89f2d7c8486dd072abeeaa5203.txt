(a)

where the Application is made under section 121, make a Recognition Order declaring the Applicant to be a Recognised Investment Exchange;

(b)

where the Application is made under section 122, make a Recognition Order declaring the Applicant to be a Recognised Clearing House.

(3)

A Recognition Order must specify a date on which it is to take effect.

(4)

Section 135 has effect in relation to a decision to refuse to make a Recognition Order—

(a)

as it has effect in relation to a decision to revoke such an order; and

(b)

as if references to a Recognised Body were references to the Applicant.

Where a person has applied to the Regulator for a Recognition Order, or a Recognised Body, Remote Body or Remote Member has applied to the Regulator for the variation of a Recognition Order previously granted, the Regulator may impose on that person such Requirements, taking effect on or after the giving or variation of the Recognition Order, as the Regulator considers appropriate.

cancel such a Requirement.

The Regulator's power under subsection (2) is referred to in these Regulations as its Own-Initiative Requirement Power.

(4)

The Regulator may refuse an application under subsection (1) for the variation of a Recognition Order if it appears to it that it is desirable to do so in order to further one or more of its objectives.

124B. Requirements under section 124A: further provisions

A Requirement may be imposed by reference to the person's relationship with—

the person's Group; or

(b)

other members of the person's Group.

if no date is specified in the notice, when the matter to which the notice relates is no longer open to review.

(3)

The imposition or variation of a Requirement may be expressed to take effect immediately or on a specified date only if the Regulator, having regard to the grounds on which it is exercising its Own-Initiative Requirement Power, reasonably considers that it is
