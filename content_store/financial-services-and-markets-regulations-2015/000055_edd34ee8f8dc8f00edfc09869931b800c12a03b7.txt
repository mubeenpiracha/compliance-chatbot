irrespective of the law applicable to the Market Contract or the Default Rules.

The powers of a Relevant Office-Holder in his capacity as such, and the powers of the Court under the Insolvency Regulations shall not be exercised in such a way as to prevent or interfere with—

(a)

any action taken under the Default Rules of a Recognised Body or Remote Body;

(b)

the Settlement in accordance with the rules of a Recognised Body or Remote Body of a Market Contract not dealt with under its Default Rules;

(c)

the transfer of a Clearing Member Client Contract, or the Settlement of a Clearing Member Client Contract or a Clearing Member House Contract, in accordance with the Default Rules of a Recognised Clearing House or Remote Clearing House;

(d)

where a Clearing Member Client Contract transferred in accordance with the Default Rules of a Recognised Clearing House or Remote Clearing House was entered into by the Clearing Member or Client as principal, the transfer of a Client Trade or group of Client Trades corresponding to that Clearing Member contract;

(e)

the transfer of a Qualifying Collateral Arrangement in conjunction with a transfer of a Clearing Member Client Contract as mentioned in paragraph (c), or a transfer of a Client Trade as mentioned in paragraph (d);

(f)

any action taken to give effect to any of the matters mentioned in paragraphs (c) to (e);

(g)

any action taken to give effect to a Qualifying Property Transfer;

(h)

a Collateral Security Arrangement;

(i)

orders for the delivery of Cash or non-Cash collateral to or from a Recognised Body or Remote Body which have become final and irrevocable under the rules of the Recognised Body or Remote Body; and

(j)

the Settlement or delivery of a product or security subject of a Market Contract following expiry or close-out of the Market Contract pursuant to the rules of a Recognised Body or Remote Body.

This does not prevent a Relevant Office-Holder from afterwards seeking to recover any amount under sections 159(5) or 160(3) or prevent the Court from afterwards making any such order or decree as is mentioned in sections 161(1) (but subject to subsections (2) and (3) of that section).

Nothing in the following provisions of this Part shall be construed as affecting the generality of the above provisions.

A debt or other liability arising out of a Market Contract which is the subject of Default Proceedings may not be proved in a Winding-Up or bankruptcy or in the Administration of a Company or other body, until the completion of the Default Proceedings. A debt or

98

other liability which by virtue of this subsection may not be proved or claimed shall not be taken into account for the purposes of any set off until the completion of the Default Proceedings.

(5)

However, prior to the completion of Default Proceedings—

(a)

where it appears to the chairman of the meeting of creditors that a sum will be certified under section 158(1) to be payable, subsection (4) shall not prevent any proof or claim including or consisting of an estimate of that sum which has been lodged from being admitted for the purpose only of determining the entitlement of a creditor to vote at a meeting of creditors; and

(b)

a creditor whose claim or proof has been lodged and admitted for the purpose of determining the entitlement of a creditor to vote at a meeting of creditors and which has not been subsequently wholly withdrawn, disallowed or rejected, is eligible as a creditor to be a member of a Liquidation Committee or, or in the Administration of a Company or other body a Creditors' Committee (both as defined in the Insolvency Regulations).

(6)

For the purposes of subsections (4) and (5) the Default Proceedings shall be taken to be completed in relation to a person when a report is made under section 158 stating the sum (if any) certified to be due to or from him.

156. Duty to give assistance for purposes of Default Proceedings93

(1)

It is the duty of—

(a)

any person who has or had control of any assets of a Defaulter; and

(b)

any person who has or had control of any Documents of or relating to a Defaulter;

to give a Recognised Body or Remote Body such assistance as it may reasonably require for the purposes of its Default Proceedings.

This applies notwithstanding any duty of that person under the Insolvency Regulations.
