216. Exercise of power in support of Non-ADGM Regulators158

(1)

The Regulator's Own-Initiative Powers may be exercised in respect of an Authorised Person or Recognised Body at the request of, or for the purpose of assisting, a Non-ADGM Regulator.

(2)

If a request to the Regulator for the exercise of its Own-Initiative Powers has been made by a Non-ADGM Regulator, the Regulator must, in deciding whether or not to exercise those powers in response to the request, consider whether it is necessary to do so.

(3)

In deciding whether or not to do so, in any case in which the Regulator does not consider that the exercise of its Own-Initiative Powers is necessary, it may take into account in particular—

(a)

whether in the country, territory or jurisdiction of the Non-ADGM Regulator concerned, corresponding assistance would be given to the Regulator;

(b)

whether the case concerns the breach of a law, or other requirement, which has no close parallel in the Abu Dhabi Global Market or involves the assertion of a jurisdiction not recognised by the Abu Dhabi Global Market;

(c)

the seriousness of the case and its importance to persons in the Abu Dhabi Global Market;

(d)

whether it is otherwise appropriate in the public interest to give the assistance sought;

(e)

whether it would further one or more of the Regulator's objectives.

(4)

The Regulator may decide not to exercise its Own-Initiative Powers, in response to a request made under subsection (1), unless the Non-ADGM Regulator concerned undertakes to make such contribution towards the cost of their exercise as the Regulator considers appropriate.
