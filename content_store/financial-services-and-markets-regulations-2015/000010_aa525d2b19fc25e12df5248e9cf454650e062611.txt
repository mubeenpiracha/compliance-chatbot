 Court must—

(a)

if the case arises as a result of section 21, have regard to whether the person carrying on the Regulated Activity concerned reasonably believed that he was not contravening the General Prohibition by making the Agreement; or

(b)

if the case arises as a result of section 22, have regard to whether the Provider knew that the Third Party was, in carrying on the Regulated Activity, contravening the General Prohibition.

If the Court is satisfied that it is just and equitable in the circumstances of the case, it may allow—

(a)

the Agreement to be enforced; or

(b)

money and property paid or transferred under the Agreement to be retained.

If the person against whom the Agreement is unenforceable—

(a)

elects not to perform the Agreement; or

(b)

as a result of this section, recovers money paid or other property transferred by him under the Agreement;

he must repay any money and return any other property received by him under the Agreement.

If property transferred under the agreement has passed to a Third Party, a reference in section 21 or 22 or this section to that property is to be read as a reference to its value at the time of its transfer under the Agreement.

The commission of a contravention of the General Prohibition or the Financial Promotion Restriction does not make the agreement concerned illegal or invalid to any greater extent than is provided by section 21 or 22.

Accepting Deposits in breach of General Prohibition

This section applies to an agreement between a person (the "depositor") and another person (the "deposit-taker") made in the course of the carrying on by the deposit-taker of the Regulated Activity of Accepting Deposits in contravention of the General Prohibition.

If the depositor is not entitled under the agreement to recover without delay any money deposited by him, he may apply to the Court for an order directing the deposit-taker to return the money to him.

The Court need not make such an order if it is satisfied that it would not be just and equitable for the money deposited to be returned, having regard to whether the deposit-taker reasonably believed that he was not contravening the General Prohibition by making the agreement.

Enforceability of Agreements resulting from Unlawful Communications

If, in consequence of an Unlawful Communication, a person Engages in Investment Activity as a Customer, any agreement entered into by him as a part of that activity is unenforceable against him and he is entitled to recover—

(a)

any money or other property paid or transferred by him under the agreement; and

(b)

compensation for any loss sustained by him as a result of having parted with it.

If, in consequence of an Unlawful Communication a person exercises any rights conferred by a Specified Investment, no obligation to which he is subject as a result of exercising them is enforceable against him and he is entitled to recover—

(a)

any money or other property paid or transferred by him under the obligation; and

(b)

compensation for any loss sustained by him as a result of having parted with it.

The Court may allow—

(a)

the agreement or obligation to be enforced; or

(b)

money or property paid or transferred under the agreement or obligation to be retained;

if it is satisfied that it is just and equitable in the circumstances of the case.

In considering whether to allow the agreement or obligation to be enforced or (as the case may be) the money or property paid or transferred under the agreement to be retained, the Court must have regard to—

(a)

if the Applicant made the Unlawful Communication, whether he reasonably believed that he was not making such a communication; and

(b)

if the Applicant did not make the Unlawful Communication, whether he knew that the agreement was entered into in consequence of such a communication.
