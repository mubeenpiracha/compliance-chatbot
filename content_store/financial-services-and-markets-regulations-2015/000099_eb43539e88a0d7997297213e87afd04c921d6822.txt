 this section applies was given, in so far as the material to which access must be given under that section relates to the matter which identifies the Third Party.

(13)

A copy of a notice given to a Third Party under this section must be accompanied by a description of the effect of section 255 as it applies to him.

(14)

Any person to whom a warning notice or decision notice was copied under this section must be given a copy of a Notice of Discontinuance applicable to the proceedings to which the warning notice or decision notice is related.

255. Access to Regulator material

(1)

If the Regulator gives a person ("A") a notice to which this section applies, it must—

(a)

allow him access to the material on which it relied in making the decision which gave rise to the obligation to give the notice;

(b)

allow him access to any Secondary Material which, in the Regulator's opinion, might undermine that decision.

(2)

But the Regulator giving the notice does not have to allow A access to material under subsection (1) if the material is a Protected Item or it—

(a)

relates to a case involving a person other than A; and

(b)

was taken into account by the Regulator in A's case only for purposes of comparison with other cases.

(3)

The Regulator may refuse A access to particular material which it would otherwise have to allow him access to if, in its opinion, allowing him access to the material—

(a)

would not be in the public interest; or

173

(b)

would not be fair, having regard to—

(i)

the likely significance of the material to A in relation to the matter in respect of which he has been given a notice to which this section applies; and

(ii)

the potential prejudice to the commercial interests of a person other than A which would be caused by the material's disclosure.

(4)

If the Regulator does not allow A access to material because it is a Protected Item, it must give A written notice of—

(a)

the existence of the Protected Item; and

(b)

the Regulator's decision not to allow him access to it.

(5)

If the Regulator refuses under subsection (3) to allow A access to material, it must give him written notice of—

(a)

the refusal; and

(b)

the reasons for it.
