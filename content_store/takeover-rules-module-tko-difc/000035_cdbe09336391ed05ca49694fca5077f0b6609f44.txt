TAKEOVER RULES (TKO)

Guidance

1.

As a consequence of this Rule, the Target should keep a close watch on its Share price for any signs of untoward movement.

2.

The DFSA should be consulted at the latest when the Target becomes the subject of any rumour and speculation or where there is a price movement of 10% or more above the lowest Share price since the time of the approach. An abrupt price rise of a smaller percentage could also be considered abnormal. In considering whether a price movement is abnormal, the DFSA may look at a range of factors, including the general market, publicly available information, and the relevant time period.

3.

Additional information may be the subject of a later supplementary announcement.
