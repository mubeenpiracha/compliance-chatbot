The DFSA may waive or modify the application of Rule 2.4.3 if it is satisfied that circumstances are appropriate. See Chapter 16 of these Rules.

2.4.4 A Bidder must not:

(a)

make an announcement of a firm intention to make a Bid; or

(b)

take any action which would give rise to the requirement to make such an announcement;

unless the Bidder and its financial adviser have proper grounds for believing that the Bidder is and will continue to be able to implement the Bid.

2.4.5 The announcement of a firm intention to make a Bid containing a whole or partial cash consideration must include confirmation by the financial adviser or by another appropriate third party that resources are available to the Bidder sufficient to satisfy full acceptance of the Bid.
