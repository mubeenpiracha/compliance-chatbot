Guidance

1.

These Takeover Principles are prescribed in accordance with Article 53 of the Markets Law 2012. The principles have the full force and effect of Rules and are therefore binding and enforceable. They are essentially statements of good standards of commercial behaviour. They apply to all transactions with which the Takeover Rules are concerned. They are, however, expressed in broad general terms and the Markets Law 2012 and these Rules do not define the precise extent of, or the limitations on, their application.
