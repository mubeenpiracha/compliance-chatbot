In exceptional cases, certain Reporting Entities, in particular property companies, which are the subject of an unexpected Bid may find difficulty in obtaining, within the time available, the opinion of an appropriate external valuer to support an asset valuation, as required by this Section, before the Target Circular has to be sent out. In such cases, the DFSA may waive strict compliance with this requirement. The DFSA will only do this where the interests of shareholders appear on balance to be best served by permitting informal valuations to appear coupled with such substantiation as is available. Targets or their advisers who wish to make use of this procedure should consult the DFSA at the earliest opportunity.
