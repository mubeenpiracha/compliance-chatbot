Guidance

1.

Under Article 9 of the Markets Law 2012 the DFSA may waive or modify the application of the Markets Law 2012 or of the Rules.

2.

Where an obligation to make a Mandatory Bid arises as a consequence of Persons acting in concert, the DFSA should be consulted at the earliest opportunity to determine, where appropriate, which Person or Persons should mount the Bid and consequently whether any waiver or modification from this Rule is appropriate. The DFSA may, for example, require the Bid to be made by the Person who acquired the shares which triggered the obligation under Rule 4.1.1 to make the Mandatory Bid.

3.

A definition of “acting in concert” is provided in Rule 1.4.1. As a consequence of that definition, Rule 4.1.1 may require a Bid to be made even when no single Person in a group acting in concert holds 30% or more of the voting rights.
