Guidance

Where the DFSA is satisfied that disclosure under Rule 10.2.1(b) may be commercially disadvantageous to the entity concerned, it may modify these requirements so as to allow the report or schedule to appear in a summarised form. In certain cases, the DFSA may require any of these documents to be reproduced in full in a document sent to shareholders.
