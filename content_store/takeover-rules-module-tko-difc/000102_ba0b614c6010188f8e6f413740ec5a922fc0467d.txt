11.2 Closing Dates and Extensions

11.2.1 A Bidder must ensure that its Bid remains open for at least 35 days following the date

on which the Bid Document is posted.

11.2.2 Where a Bidder announces an extension of a Bid, either the next closing date must be stated or, if the Bid is unconditional as to acceptances, a statement may be made that the Bid will remain open until further notice. In the latter case, at least 14 days' notice in writing must be given, before the Bid is closed, to those shareholders who have not accepted.
