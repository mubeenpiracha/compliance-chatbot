Guidance

The DFSA may waive or modify the application of Rule 9.3.3 if it is satisfied that circumstances are appropriate. See Chapter 16 of these Rules. In exceptional circumstances, the DFSA may accept that, because of the uncertainties involved, it is not possible for a forecast previously made to be reported on in accordance with the Rules nor for a revised forecast to be made. In these circumstances, shareholders must be given a full explanation of why the requirements of the Rules are not capable of being met.

9.4.4 When a Bid Document has been posted, the reports shall be included in the document containing the forecast or, when the forecast has been made in a public announcement (whether by newspaper or any other means of publication), in a document which shall be sent to shareholders with a minimum of delay after the announcement is published. The reports must be accompanied by a statement that those making them have given and not withdrawn their consent to publication.
