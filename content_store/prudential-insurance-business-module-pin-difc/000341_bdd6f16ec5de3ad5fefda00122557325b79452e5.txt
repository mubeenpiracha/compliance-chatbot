A6.11 Reserving risk component

Guidance

1.

The purpose of the reserving risk component is to require an Insurer to set aside capital to address the risk that the cost of claims will vary from the amounts recorded as liabilities in the Insurerâ€™s balance sheet. This calculation applies only to liabilities in respect of outstanding claims (the risk of deterioration in Premium Liability is addressed in the underwriting risk component in section A6.10). The provisions in this section apply the relevant provisions of section A4.11 to the segments of a Protected Cell Company.

2.

As Insurance Business in Protected Cell Companies may only be carried on through Cells, every Insurer will have a reserving risk component of zero in respect of its Minimum Non- Cellular Capital Requirement.

A6.11.1 An Insurer must calculate the reserving risk component in respect of a segment according to the method set out in section A4.11, applied as though all references in that section to an Insurer were instead references to that segment.
