Guidance

1.

This chapter establishes a set of principles for the consistent measurement of the assets and liabilities of Insurers for the purposes of reporting under chapter 6 and for determining compliance with chapter 4.

2.

This chapter is not intended to establish a basis of accounting for general purpose financial statements of Insurers. This chapter does not prevent Insurers from adopting measurements of assets and liabilities that might be considered excessively prudent if adopted in the Insurer’s general purpose financial statements. Insurers are not however expected to mislead the DFSA as to the financial position or financial performance of the Insurer.

5.1.2

Subject to Rules 5.1.3, 5.1.4, 5.1.5 and 5.1.6, an Insurer must recognise and measure its assets and liabilities in accordance with so many of sections 5.3, 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6 as apply to the Insurer.

5.1.3

An Insurer may measure the value of an asset at less than the value determined in accordance with this chapter.
