A4.6 Off-balance sheet asset risk component

Guidance

The purpose of the off-balance sheet asset risk component is to require an Insurer to set aside capital to cover the risk of default and deterioration in value in respect of exposures that the Insurer has because it is a party to a derivative contract.

A4.6.1 An Insurer is required to calculate an off-balance sheet asset risk component, if the Insurer is, as at the Solvency Reference Date, a party to a derivative contract, including a forward, future, swap, option or other similar contract, but not including:

(a)

a put option serving as a guarantee;

(b)

a foreign exchange contract having an original maturity of 14 days or less; or

(c)

an instrument traded on a futures or options exchange, which is subject to daily mark-to-market and margin payments.

A4.6.2 An Insurer must calculate its off-balance sheet asset risk component as the sum of the amounts obtained by applying the calculations set out in Rule A4.6.3 in respect of each derivative contract entered into by the Insurer that meets the description in Rule A4.6.1.
