For the purposes of this chapter, assets and liabilities must be valued in accordance with chapter 5.

In this chapter and in the appendices referred to in this chapter, references to ratings are made according to the rating hierarchy (AAA, AA, etc) of Standard & Poor’s. Where, for the purposes of a provision of this chapter or of an appendix, an Insurer uses ratings from a Rating Agency other than Standard & Poor’s, the Insurer must apply that provision as though the Standard & Poor’s rating referred to in the provision were replaced by the rating from that other Rating Agency that is equivalent to the Standard & Poor’s rating.

An Insurer must not, for the purposes of this chapter or the appendices referred to in this chapter, use ratings provided by any Rating Agency other than Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, AM Best, and Fitch Ratings, except where the DFSA has given written approval to the Insurer for the use of ratings provided by that other Rating Agency.
