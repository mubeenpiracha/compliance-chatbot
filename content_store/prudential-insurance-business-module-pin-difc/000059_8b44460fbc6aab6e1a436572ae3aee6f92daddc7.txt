1.

The amount of capital is fundamental to the financial health of any insurance undertaking and therefore to the protection of its policyholders. All Insurers are therefore required to maintain a minimum level of capital resources in accordance with this chapter.

This chapter establishes minimum required levels of capital resources applicable to Insurers of different types. Section 4.2 establishes provisions that are applicable to all Insurers, wherever they are incorporated and of whatever type they are. Section 4.3 establishes Minimum Capital Requirements in respect of Insurers other than Protected Cell Companies, and section 4.4 establishes equivalent requirements in respect of Protected Cell Companies. Additional provisions are established by section 4.6, in respect of Insurers maintaining Long-Term Insurance Funds, and by section 4.7, in respect of Insurers that are not DIFC Incorporated Insurers.
