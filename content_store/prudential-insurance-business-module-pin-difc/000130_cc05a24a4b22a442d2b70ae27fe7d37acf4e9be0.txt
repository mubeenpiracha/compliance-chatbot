Guidance

1.

Group membership may be a source of both strength and weakness to an Insurer. The purpose of Group Risk requirements is to ensure that an Insurer takes proper account of the risks related to the Insurerâ€™s membership of a Group. The Group Risk requirements form a key part of the DFSA's overall approach to prudential supervision.

2.

An Insurer is subject to separate reporting requirements in respect of changes in its Controllers. Those requirements are set out in chapter 11 of GEN. It may also be required to provide reports in respect of any Close Links it possesses.

8.1.2

(1)

If an Insurer is a member of a Financial Group and the DFSA considers it necessary to extend the scope of the Financial Group to include entities outside of the Financial Group to ensure appropriate Financial Group supervision, an Insurer must also include in the scope of the Financial Group any entity the DFSA may direct the Insurer in writing to include.
