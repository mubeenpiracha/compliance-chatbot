A6.12 Long-term insurance risk component

Guidance

1.

The purpose of the Long-Term Insurance risk component is to require an Insurer to set aside capital to address the risk that the net present value of future Policy Benefits will vary from the amounts recorded as Long-Term Insurance Liabilities in the Insurer’s balance sheet. The provisions in this section apply the relevant provisions of section A4.12 to the segments of a Protected Cell Company.

2.

As Insurance Business in Protected Cell Companies may only be carried on through Cells, every Insurer will have a Long-Term Insurance risk component of zero in respect of its Minimum Non-Cellular Capital Requirement.

A6.12.1 An Insurer must calculate the Long-Term Insurance risk component in respect of a segment according to the method set out in section A4.12, applied as though all references in that section to an Insurer were instead references to that segment.
