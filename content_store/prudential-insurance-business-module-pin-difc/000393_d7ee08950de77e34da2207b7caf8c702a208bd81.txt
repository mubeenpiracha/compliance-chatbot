A10.4.8 Where an Insurer arranges its affairs such that a Cell or Long-Term Insurance Fund maintained by it pays or receives income in the form of interest, dividends, rental, recharge of management expenses or other investment income, from another reporting unit of the Insurer, that income must be shown gross as an expense in the reporting unit bearing the expense, and as income in the reporting unit receiving the income. Where, however, the same reporting unit records the income and the expense, the two must be netted.
