Guidance

The purpose of the default risk component is to require an Insurer to set aside capital to cover the risk that amounts receivable from counterparties will not be received. The basic calculation model for this component, set out in A4.4.1, is modified by additional provisions that permit an Insurer to take account of the reduced default risk where an asset is covered by guarantees or collateral, and impose additional capital charges on assets that are encumbered. In addition, certain assets that are left out of account in calculating an Insurerâ€™s Adjusted Capital Resources are exempt from the default risk component calculation. Excluding these assets from Adjusted Capital Resources already effectively imposes a 100% capital requirement.

A4.4.1 An Insurer must calculate its default risk component as the sum of the amounts obtained by multiplying the value of each asset of the Insurer with the percentage applicable to that asset, as set out in the tables contained in this Rule and subject to the provisions of Rules A4.4.2, A4.4.5, A4.4.6 and A4.4.7.
