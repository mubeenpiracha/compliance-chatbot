Guidance

This section requires an Insurer to set aside capital in respect of assets that it manages. The circumstances under which an Insurer may conduct asset management activities are restricted by COB.

A4.13.1 An Insurer must calculate its asset management risk component as 0.5% of the

market value of assets managed by it.

A4.13.2 Assets that are recognised as assets of the Insurer in accordance with generally

accepted accounting principles are not assets managed by it.
