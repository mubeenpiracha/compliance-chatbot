The methods of calculation for the Minimum Non-Cellular Capital Requirement and the Minimum Cellular Capital Requirement in respect of a Cell are identical, so the term Minimum Segmental Capital Requirement is used to refer to both. Similarly, the term ‘segment’ is used in this appendix to refer to both a Cell and the non-cellular part of an Insurer.

A6.2 Minimum segmental capital requirement

A6.2.1 Every Insurer must calculate its Minimum Non-Cellular Capital Requirement and the Minimum Cellular Capital Requirement applicable to each Cell, in accordance with this appendix.

A6.2.2 Subject to Rules A6.2.4, A6.2.5, and A6.2.6, an Insurer must calculate its Minimum

Segmental Capital Requirement according to the following applicable formula:

(a)

for an Insurer, other than a Captive Insurer: MCR = DRC + IVRC + OARC + OLRC + CRC + SFAC + URC + RRC + LIRC + AMRC;

(b)

for a Class 1 Captive Insurer: MCR = higher of URC and RRC; and

(c)

for a Class 2 and Class 3 Captive Insurer: MCR = DRC + IVRC + URC + RRC;
