Guidance

The effect of Rule 9.1.3 is to disregard, for the purposes of determining whether the chapter applies, Contracts of Insurance that are effected by the Insurer, as a consequence of a term of an existing Contract of Insurance. A contract will normally only be regarded as being effected under a term of an existing contract if the Insurer does not have discretion to decline to effect the new contract, or if it would be unreasonable for the Insurer, having regard to the interests of the policyholder, to decline to effect it.
