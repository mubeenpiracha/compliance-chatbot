In discharging its responsibilities under Rule 3.6.2, and under the high level requirements to which it is subject under GEN Rule 5.3.1, senior management will need to consider specific risks to which the Insurer is exposed as a consequence of its activity within each jurisdiction. Internal governance procedures such as Internal Audit should include examination of non- DIFC activities. Compliance procedures should be designed to ensure that the Insurer complies with any domestic regulation to which it may be subject in the jurisdiction in which it is doing business. Insurers are also expected to ensure that conduct of business by them in other jurisdictions does not pose any risk to the reputation of the DIFC. Consequently, senior management should ensure that adequate standards of customer protection are adopted by the Insurerâ€™s operation in each jurisdiction. Senior management should have regard to the provisions of GEN section 4.2 and in particular Principles 6, 7, 8 and 9 in considering whether standards of consumer protection are adequate. Review of persistency statistics may assist in identifying problems in the area of conduct of business.
