Guidance

1.

Rule 4.2.3(1)(a) applies at the time that a contract is effected. Circumstances may arise in which premiums subsequently prove to be inadequate. However, this does not create a breach of the requirement in that subparagraph. Neither does the fact that an individual contract might suffer a large loss.

2.

An Insurer should be able to demonstrate that its procedures allow for prior assessment and periodic review of premium adequacy of Direct Long-Term Insurance contracts that it writes. The assessment will consider the adequacy of premiums taking into account projected revenues and expenses in respect of the relevant contracts, including the likely impact of any discretionary features. In making this assessment, credit should not be taken for the impact of voluntary discontinuance (lapse, surrender of or making the contract paid-up) by the policyholder. The DFSA does not consider it appropriate for the projected profitability of Direct Long-Term Insurance contracts to be dependent on ‘lapse support’.
