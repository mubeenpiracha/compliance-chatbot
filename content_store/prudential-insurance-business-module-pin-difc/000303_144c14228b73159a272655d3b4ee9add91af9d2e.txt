Guidance

1.

The purpose of these adjustments is to provide a consistent basis for the determination of the Insurer’s Adjusted Non-Cellular Capital Resources and to exclude from those resources assets that may not be readily realisable for the purposes of meeting any Non-Cellular Liabilities of the Insurer.

2.

A Takaful Insurer may not count as non-cellular capital amounts loaned to Insurance Funds that are attributable to Cells, as those amounts will be counted towards base cellular capital of the Cells concerned.
