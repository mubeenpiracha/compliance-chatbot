If the Regulator determines that there are material deficiencies in a Resolution Plan or material impediments to its implementation, it shall notify the relevant Institution of its assessment in writing and require the Institution to submit, within two months, extendable with the Regulator's approval, a revised Resolution Plan demonstrating how those deficiencies or impediments have been addressed.

If the Institution fails to submit a revised Resolution Plan within the specified timeframe, or the Regulator determines that a matter notified under subsection (5) has not been adequately addressed in the revised Resolution Plan, the Regulator may direct the Institution to take any measures it considers to be necessary and proportionate, including any of the steps in section 9(5).
