Where the Regulator decides to exclude or partially exclude an Eligible Liability or class of Eligible Liabilities under subsection (8), the level of write down or conversion applied to other Eligible Liabilities may be increased to take account of such exclusions, provided that the level of write down or conversion applied to other Eligible Liabilities complies with the General Resolution Principles specified in section 25(g).

In exercising its discretion under subsection (8), the Regulator shall give due consideration toâ€”

(a)

the need not to apply any bail-in to a netting set prior to such netting being completed;

(b)

the need to avoid disruption to payment and securities settlement systems, Central Securities Depositories, clearing houses and Recognised Clearing Houses;

(c)

the principle that losses shall be borne first by Shareholders and subsequently by creditors of the Institution in Resolution in order of preference in light of section 25(g);

(d)

the level of loss absorbing capacity that would remain in the Institution in Resolution if the liability or class of liabilities were excluded; and
