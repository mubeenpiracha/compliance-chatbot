In assessing a Group Recovery Plan, the Regulator may consider the potential impact of the recovery measures on financial stability in all the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. In doing so, the Regulator may consult the supervisory authorities and resolution authorities of the jurisdictions in which any Group Entities or Branches are located.

If the Regulator determines that there are material deficiencies in a Recovery Plan, or material impediments to its implementation, it shall notify the relevant Institution of its assessment in writing and require the Institution to submit, within two months, extendable with the Regulator's approval by one month, a revised Recovery Plan demonstrating how those deficiencies or impediments have been addressed.
