Procedural requirements after creation of a Resolution Order or Share Transfer Order

As soon as is reasonably practicable after the creation of a Resolution Order or a Share Transfer Order by which a Resolution Action is taken (including pursuant to a Foreign Resolution Order), the Regulator shall publish or procure the publication of a copy of the Resolution Order or Share Transfer Order or a notice summarising the key terms of the Resolution Order or Share Transfer Order by the following meansâ€”

(a)

by publishing it on the websites of both the Regulator and the Institution in Resolution;

(b)

by publishing it on any national or international newspaper available for general sale in the UAE or other publication which in the opinion of the Regulator would maximise the likelihood of the Resolution Order coming to the attention of affected persons; and

(c)

if securities issued by the Institution in Resolution have been admitted to trading on a Recognised Investment Exchange or foreign exchange, by means of a relevant regulatory information service used on that exchange.
