For the purposes of the assessment of resolvability referred to under subsection (1), the Regulator shall, as a minimum, consider the matters set out in Part 4 of the Schedule (with any necessary modifications for the Group level). The Regulator shall carry out any potential resolvability assessment in pursuit of the Resolution Objectives and in accordance with the General Resolution Principles.

Powers to address or remove impediments to resolvability

If a resolvability assessment identifies any material impediments to resolvability, these may be notified in writing by the Regulator to the relevant Institution and, where applicable, to the relevant resolution authorities in other jurisdictions in which the Institution or Group Entities operate.

An Institution shall, within three months of the date of receipt of a notification under subsection (1) or such other time period as may be specified in such notification, propose to the Regulator possible measures to address or remove the substantive impediments identified in the notification. The Regulator shall determine whether the measures referred to effectively address or remove the substantive impediments.
