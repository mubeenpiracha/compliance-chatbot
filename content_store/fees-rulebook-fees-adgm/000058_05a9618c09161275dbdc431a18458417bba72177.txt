Guidance

1. The filing of a Supplementary Prospectus for a Public Fund does not trigger the payment of a fee unless the review of the Supplementary Prospectus will require the Regulator to incur substantial additional costs or expend substantial additional effort when conducting its review, in which event the Regulator may require payment of a supplementary fee in accordance with Rule 1.2.4.

2. A person seeking or wishing to retain the designation of a Fund as an ADGM Green Fund or an ADGM Climate Transition Fund must pay the relevant fee as set out in Chapter 10.
