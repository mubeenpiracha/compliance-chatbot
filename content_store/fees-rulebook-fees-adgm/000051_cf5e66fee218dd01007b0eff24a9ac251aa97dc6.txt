Guidance

The Regulator may charge a supplementary fee in addition to the fee specified in Rule 6.1.1 where:

a.

the Controller is from a jurisdiction where there is no adequate memorandum of understanding in place between the Regulator and the relevant Non-ADGM Financial Services Regulator in that jurisdiction;

b.

the Controller proposes, in connection with their approval, to change the business model, business activities, or senior management of the Authorised Person or Recognised Body; or

c.

the application will otherwise require the Regulator to incur substantial additional expense or expend substantial additional effort due to its complexity.
