Guidance

1.

Defined terms are identified throughout the Rulebook by the capitalisation of the initial letter of a word or of each word in a phrase. Unless the context otherwise requires, where capitalisation of the initial letter or letters is not used, an expression has its natural meaning.

2.

A word or phrase which appears with capitalisation of the initial letter, but is not itself defined should be read in the same sense as the expression to which it relates, for example ‘Advice on Financial Products’ is related to ‘Advising on Financial Products’, so the reader should refer to the definition of ‘Advising on Financial Products’ for its meaning.

3.

Many of the defined expressions in GLO are used or defined in the relevant DIFC law or in legislation made under it. In these cases, GLO may refer to the statutory provision which is the source of the Rulebook definition. Where there is a short statutory definition, GLO sets out the definition in full. Where the statutory definition is long, GLO gives a summary of it, and states that it is a summary.
