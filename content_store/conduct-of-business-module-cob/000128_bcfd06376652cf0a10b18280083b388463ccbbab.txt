Suitability assessment when Providing Trust Services

6.

An Authorised Firm Providing Trust Services does not have to undertake an assessment of the factors such as risk tolerance, knowledge and experience of a Client when assessing the suitability of the service to a particular Client. This is because those considerations are not relevant to the activity of Providing Trust Services.

Suitability assessment when recommending a Credit Facility

7.

An Authorised Firm that recommends to a Client a particular Credit Facility as suitable for that Client, needs to consider whether the facility is suitable for the Client in terms of its affordability by the Client. An Authorised Firm acting as a credit broker for a Client would need to consider not only the affordability of the facility for the Client, but also whether the product is suitable compared to other credit products available in the market. However, a provider of a Credit Facility is only required to assess the suitability for a particular Client if it makes a recommendation to that Client.
