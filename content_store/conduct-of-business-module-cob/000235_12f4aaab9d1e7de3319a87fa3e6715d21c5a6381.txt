An Authorised Firm would have to consider the need to give a new warning to an existing Retail Client where there is a material change to the risk profile of the type of Restricted Speculative Investments offered to the Retail Client i.e. from those specified in a warning previously given to that Retail Client under Rule 16.6.4(1). The DFSA considers issuing a new warning will be appropriate, if the risks associated with a new Restricted Speculative Investment to be offered to the Retail Client are materially different to those previously offered, due to factors such as the volatility of the underlying reference or leverage.
