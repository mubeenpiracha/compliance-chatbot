Application

14.3.2 This section applies to an Authorised Firm that is a Digital Wallet Service Provider.

Guidance

1.

An Investment Token is an Investment, as defined in GEN Rule A2.1.1. The Financial Service of Providing Custody, as defined in GEN Rule 2.13.1, therefore includes Providing Custody of an Investment Token, and a Person carrying on that Financial Service will require a Licence to do so.

2.

An Authorised Firm which is Providing Custody of Investment Tokens is, in addition to the requirements in this section, subject to other relevant requirements that apply to a firm Providing Custody of Investments. Other requirements include the Client Asset requirements in section 6.11, the Client Investment and Client Crypto Token requirements in section 6.13 and the Safe Custody Provisions in App 6.

3.

The Rules in this section will not apply to a Person providing a Digital Wallet to a Person who uses it for Self Custody of Investment Tokens, as the Security Tokens in that Digital Wallet are then held and controlled by that Person at their own risk.
