Guidance

1.

An Authorised Firm is subject to the requirements in the DFSA’s AML module. Members of an Authorised Firm which are themselves Authorised Firms are also subject, by virtue of being Authorised Firms, to the requirements in the DFSA’s AML module.

2.

In determining whether an ATS Operator’s measures are adequate and appropriate to reduce the extent to which its facilities can be used for Market Abuse, the DFSA will consider:

a.

whether the ATS Operator has appropriate staff, surveillance systems, resources and procedures for this purpose;

b.

the monitoring conducted for possible patterns of normal, abnormal or improper use of those facilities;

c.

how promptly and accurately information is communicated about Market Abuse to the DFSA and other appropriate organisations; and

d.

how the ATS Operator co-operates with relevant bodies in the prevention, investigation and pursuit of Market Abuse.

3.

An ATS Operator must have regard to Part 6 of the Markets Law in relation to forms of Market Abuse. Practices that amount to market manipulation (which is Market Abuse) in an automated trading environment which an ATS should be able to identify and prevent in order to promote proper markets include the following:

a.

entering small orders in order to ascertain the level of hidden orders, particularly used to assess what is resting on a dark platform, called Ping Orders;

b.

entering large numbers of orders and/or cancellations/updates to orders to create uncertainty for other market participants, to slow down their process and to camouflage the ATS Operator’s own strategy, called Quote Stuffing;

c.

entry of orders or a series of orders intended to start or exacerbate a trend, and to encourage other participants to accelerate or extend the trend in order to create an opportunity to unwind/open a position at a favourable price, called Moment Ignition; and

d.

submitting multiple orders often away from one side of the order book with the intention of executing a trade on the other side of the order book, where once that trade has taken place, the manipulative orders will be removed, called Layering and Spoofing.
