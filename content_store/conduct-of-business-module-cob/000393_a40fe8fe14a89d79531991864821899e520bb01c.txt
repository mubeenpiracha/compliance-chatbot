Guidance

When assessing whether an ATS Operator has an appropriate and adequate error trade policy, the DFSA will consider whether the rules and procedures included in its Operating Rules:

a.

are adequate to minimise the impact of error trades where prevention of such trades is not possible;

b.

are sufficiently flexible in the design to address varying scenarios;

c.

establish a predictable and timely process for dealing with Error Trades, including measures specifically designed to detect and identify Error Trade messages to market users;
