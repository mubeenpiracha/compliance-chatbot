The Rule does not prohibit an operator itself from lending money to a borrower, or investing in an Issuer or in the property of a seller, that uses the platform. However, if it does so, it is likely to be carrying on a separate Financial Service of Providing Credit or Dealing in Investments as Principal and require an additional authorisation for that activity. As well as complying with additional Rules relating to capital and the conduct of that business, it would need to take reasonable steps to prevent or manage conflicts of interests that may arise between its interests and those of its Clients (see Rule 3.5.1). If the operator discloses conflicts of interests to Clients under Rule 3.5.1, it should disclose details of each specific transaction that creates a potential conflict of interest.
