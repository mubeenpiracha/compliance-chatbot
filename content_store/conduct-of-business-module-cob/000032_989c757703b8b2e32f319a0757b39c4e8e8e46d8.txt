Investment research and offers of securities

Application

6.3.1

This section applies to an Authorised Firm preparing or publishing Investment Research.

Guidance

Investment Research is seen as a significant potential source of conflicts of interest within an Authorised Firm and therefore an Authorised Firm preparing or publishing investment research is expected to have adequate procedures, systems and controls to manage effectively any conflicts that arise.

6.3.2

An Authorised Firm that prepares and publishes Investment Research must have adequate procedures and controls to ensure:

(a)

the effective supervision and management of Investment Analysts;

(c)

that the Investment Research issued to Clients is impartial; and

(d)

that the Investment Research contains the disclosures described under Rules 6.3.3 and 6.3.4.

Guidance

An Authorised Firm’s procedures, controls and internal arrangements, which may include Chinese Walls, should limit the extent of Investment Analysts participation in corporate finance business and sales and trading activities, and ensure remuneration structures do not affect their independence.
