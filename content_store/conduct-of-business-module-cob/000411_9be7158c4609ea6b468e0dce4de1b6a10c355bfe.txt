Guidance

1.

An ATS Operator is not authorised under its Licence to provide clearing and settlement services. Therefore, it must make suitable arrangements relating to clearing and settlement of transactions that are undertaken on its facility. For this purpose, it may arrange for its members to obtain such services from an appropriately licensed Person.

2.

For the clearing and settlement of Crypto Tokens, the DFSA would still expect to see an appropriately licensed entity interposed between counterparties to trades taking place on a MTF. However, due to a combination of reasons (e.g. lack of general regulation, absence of service providers, immature technologies and business models, interoperability issues between fiat and token markets), the ATS Operator may not be able to demonstrate proper clearing arrangements through a Central Counterparty at this stage of token market development.
