The exceptions in Rule 6.3.6(2) allow an Authorised Firm to continue to provide key services to the market and to its Clients even if the Authorised Firm would be considered to have knowledge of the timing and content of the Investment Research which is intended for publication to Clients, for example when it is impractical for an Authorised Firm to put in place a Chinese Wall because the Authorised Firm has few Employees or cannot otherwise separate its functions.
