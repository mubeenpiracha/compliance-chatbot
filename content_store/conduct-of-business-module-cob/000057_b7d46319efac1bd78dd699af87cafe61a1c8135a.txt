Guidance

1.

Although an Authorised Firm is not required to undertake a detailed assessment of a ‘deemed’ Professional Client’s expertise or net assets (as is required in the case of an ‘assessed’ Professional Client), a firm still needs to have a reasonable basis for classifying a Person as falling within the list of ‘deemed’ Professional Clients in Rule 2.3.4(1) or (2). For example, in order to verify whether a trustee of a trust can be classified as a ‘deemed’ Professional Client under Rule 2.3.4(1)(j), an Authorised Firm should obtain a verified copy of the most recent balance sheet of the relevant trust.

2.

An individual trustee on the board of a trust where the trust has at least $10 million assets under its control can qualify as a ‘deemed’ Professional Client under Rule 2.3.4(1)(j) but only in relation to that particular trust.
