Guidance

1.

Rule 2.3.5(1)(c) enables an Authorised Firm to classify an Undertaking as a Professional Client for the purposes of Providing Credit for businesses purposes, not only for the Undertaking itself, but also for its related entities (such as a controller or member of its Group) as specified in that Rule, provided that the Undertaking has not opted-in to be classified as a Retail Client.

2.

It is possible that an Undertaking obtaining credit may also fall within the category of a ‘deemed’ Professional Client under Rule 2.3.4 – see, for example, a Large Undertaking under Rule 2.3.4(2). An Authorised Firm may Provide Credit to such a Person without having to meet the requirements in Rule 2.3.5.
