(b)

ensure that its Credit Ratings are not influenced by any considerations other than those which are relevant in accordance with its published methodologies and models as applicable to the particular Rating Subject; and

Guidance

1.

A Credit Rating Agency should neither take, nor forbear or refrain from taking, any Rating Action based on its potential effect (economic, political or otherwise) on the Credit Rating Agency, its Rating Subjects, investors or any other market participants (for example, the existence or non-existence of business relationship between the Credit Rating Agency or a member of its Group and the Rating Subject).

2.

The determination of a Credit Rating should be influenced only by factors relevant to the credit assessment in accordance with its published methodologies and models as applicable to the particular Rating Subject.

3.

A Credit Rating Agency should, at a minimum, set out clearly when conflicts of interest arise and, in relation to what type of business or commercial dealings or transactions, and between whom, such conflicts of interest can arise.

4. Where the Rating Subject (such as a government) has, or is simultaneously pursuing, any oversight function relating to the Credit Rating Agency, the Credit Rating Agency should avoid assigning Employees involved in the Credit Rating of the Rating Subject for also discharging any function relating to the Credit Rating Agencyâ€™s oversight.

Provision of consultancy and ancillary services

(1)

A Credit Rating Agency must not provide to a Rating Subject or a Related Party of a Rating Subject consultancy or advisory services relating to the corporate or legal structure, assets, liabilities or activities of such Rating Subject or Related Party.

(2)

For the purposes of (1), a Related Party of a Rating Subject is:

(a)

an undertaking which is in the same Group as the Rating Subject;

(b)

any Person who interacts with the Credit Rating Agency in respect of the Credit Rating; or

(c)

any Person who has a significant business or other relationship with the Rating Subject or any Person referred to in (a) or (b).

(3)

Without prejudice to (1), a Credit Rating Agency may provide services which are ancillary to its Credit Rating Activities to a Rating Subject or a Related Party of the Rating Subject where it:

(a)

has a clear definition of what services it considers as ancillary services;

(b)

documents why such services are considered not to raise any conflicts of interest with its Credit Rating Activities; and

(c)

has in place adequate mechanisms to minimise the potential for any conflicts of interest arising.

(4)

If a member of the Group in which the Credit Rating Agency is also a member provides services of the kind referred to in (1) to a Rating Subject of the Credit Rating Agency or a Related Party of such a Rating Subject, such services must be operationally and functionally separated from the business of the Credit Rating Agency.

Guidance

1.

The prohibition in Rule 8.5.2(1) includes, for example, making proposals or recommendations regarding the design or structure of Rating Subjects, including suggestions as to how a desired rating could be achieved. Therefore, such services cannot be provided.

2.

Some of the activities which are prohibited under Rule 8.5.2(1) may constitute a Financial Service other than Operating a Credit Rating Agency. Even if a Credit Rating Agency has an authorisation to provide such a Financial Service, it is prevented from providing such services to a Rating Subject or a Related Party because of the prohibition in Rule 8.5.2(1).

3.

Ancillary services referred to in Rule 8.5.2(3) include, for example, market forecasts, estimates of economic trends, pricing analysis and other general data analysis as well as related distribution services. These services can be provided to Rating Subjects and their Related Parties where the requirements in Rule 8
