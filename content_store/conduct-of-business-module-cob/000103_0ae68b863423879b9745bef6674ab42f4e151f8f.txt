Guidance

1.

The introduction of the new client classification regime does not trigger the need to re-classify existing Clients. However, with regard to an existing Client who has been grandfathered under Rule 2.6.1, the need for a re-classification may subsequently arise in a number of circumstances such as those set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.

2. Where a Professional Client grandfathered under Rule 2.6.1 subsequently requests to opt-in as a Retail Client under Rule 2.4.1(3), the Authorised Firm will need to re-classify that Client in accordance with the requirements in that Rule.
