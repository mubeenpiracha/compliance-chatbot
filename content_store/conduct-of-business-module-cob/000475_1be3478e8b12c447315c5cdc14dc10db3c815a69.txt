fees it charges for the use of the facility are designed to recover its costs of providing the facility, rather than generating additional income.

Guidance

1.

A facility for the transfer of rights and obligations under loan agreements or for the sale of Investments should exist mainly to provide an exit route for lenders or investors rather than being a facility for the active trading of loans or Investments. For example, the operator should ensure that transferees or buyers are Clients who already initially lent money to either the particular borrower or another borrower, or initially invested funds in the Issuer or property or another Issuer or property, using the platform. That is, the facility should not be used by persons who are only involved in secondary trading of loans or Investments.

2.

The conditions in Rule 11.3.16 apply only to a transfer or sale using the facility provided by the operator. They do not affect transfers of rights and obligations or sales of Investments that may occur outside that facility, for example, by operation of law such as under a will or by a Court order.
