 arise if an Investment Analyst prepares Investment Research solely for an Authorised Firm’s own use and not for publication. For example, if the research material is prepared solely for the purposes of the Authorised Firm’s proprietary trading then the use of this information would fall outside the restrictions placed on publications.

Restriction on own account transactions

(1) Unless (2) applies, an Authorised Firm or its Associate must not knowingly execute an Own Account Transaction in an Investment, Crypto Token or related Investment, which is the subject of Investment Research, prepared either by the Authorised Firm or its Associate, until the Clients for whom the Investment Research was principally intended have had a reasonable opportunity to act upon it.

(2) The restriction in (1) does not apply if:

(a)

the Authorised Firm or its Associate is a Market Maker in the relevant Investment or Crypto Token;

(b)

the Authorised Firm or its Associate undertakes an Execution-Only Transaction for a Client; or

(c)

it is not expected to materially affect the price of the Investment or Crypto Token.

Guidance

The exceptions in Rule 6.3.6(2) allow an Authorised Firm to continue to provide key services to the market and to its Clients even if the Authorised Firm would be considered to have knowledge of the timing and content of the Investment Research which is intended for publication to Clients, for example when it is impractical for an Authorised Firm to put in place a Chinese Wall because the Authorised Firm has few Employees or cannot otherwise separate its functions.

CONDUCT OF BUSINESS (COB)

Offers of securities

6.3.7 When an Authorised Firm carries out a mandate to manage an Offer of Securities, it must implement adequate internal arrangements, in accordance with section 3.5, to manage any conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of the Authorised Firm’s duty to two distinct sets of Clients namely the corporate finance Client and the investment Client.

Disclosure

6.3.8

For the purposes of Rule 6.3.7, when an Authorised Firm accepts a mandate to manage an Offer, it must take reasonable steps to disclose to its corporate finance Client:

(a)

the process the Authorised Firm proposes to adopt in order to determine what recommendations it will make about allocations for the Offer;

(b)

details of how the target investor group, to whom it is planned to Offer the Securities, will be identified;

(c)

the process through which recommendations are prepared and by whom; and

(d)

(if relevant) that it may recommend placing Securities with a Client of the Authorised Firm for whom the Authorised Firm provides other services, with the Authorised Firm’s own proprietary book, or with an Associate, and that this represents a potential conflict of interest.

Guidance

It is the DFSA’s expectation that an Authorised Firm’s procedures to identify and manage conflicts of interest should extend to the allocation process for an offering of Securities.

6.4

Best execution

Application
