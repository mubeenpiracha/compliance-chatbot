The DFSA expects that it would be only in limited circumstances that a material change would occur during the commitment period. This is because full information about the borrower, Issuer, seller or property will only recently have been verified and published (see Rules 11.3.6 and 11.3.7). As a material change during the commitment period could significantly affect a lender or investorâ€™s decision, in addition to notifying investors or lenders, the operator must require anyone who has already committed to lend or invest to reconfirm their commitment. This reconfirmation is separate from the cooling-off period for investors under Rule 11.5.2 or 11.6.5 which starts when the commitment period ends.
