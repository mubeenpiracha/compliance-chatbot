belonging to the Person; and

(d) may include any other assets held directly or indirectly by that Person.

Guidance

1.

The reference to “assets held directly or indirectly” is designed to include assets held by direct legal ownership, by beneficial ownership (for example, as a beneficiary in a trust), or by both legal and beneficial ownership. Such assets may be held, for instance, through a special purpose or personal investment vehicle, a foundation, or the like. Similarly, any real property held subject to an Islamic mortgage, where the lender has the legal title to the property, may be counted as indirectly held property of a Client, less the amount owing on the mortgage, where it is not a primary residence.

2.

As the test is to determine the net assets (not gross assets) of an individual, any mortgages or other charges held over the property to secure any indebtedness of the individual should be deducted from the value of the assets.
