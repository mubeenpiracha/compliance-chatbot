Guidance

1.

An ‘auto-lending system’ or ‘auto-investing system’ is a facility that automatically allocates certain loans or Investments to a lender or investor according to parameters chosen by the lender or investor. The availability of this type of facility creates the risk that other lenders may not be aware that the best lending or investment opportunities have already been allocated and that remaining lending or investment opportunities may be of lower quality.

2.

Further, if an operator permits some lenders or investors using its service to lend or invest on terms that are better than those offered to other lenders or investors on the platform, a potential conflict of interest may arise between the interests of the different lenders or investors. The operator will need to consider under Rule 3.5.1 what steps it should take to ensure that other Clients are not prejudiced by the conflict of interest.
