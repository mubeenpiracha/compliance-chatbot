Guidance

The DFSA does not consider the same conflicts of interest mentioned in this section arise if an Investment Analyst prepares Investment Research solely for an Authorised Firm’s own use and not for publication. For example, if the research material is prepared solely for the purposes of the Authorised Firm’s proprietary trading then the use of this information would fall outside the restrictions placed on publications.
