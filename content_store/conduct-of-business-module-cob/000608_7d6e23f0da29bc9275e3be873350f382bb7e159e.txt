In this Rule, “staking” means participating in the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism on the DLT or other similar technology that hosts the relevant Crypto Token.

Guidance

Staking refers to the activity where holders of Crypto Tokens lend their Tokens to firms, miners or other persons, in exchange for a return or other reward for the use of the Tokens. Rule 15.6.5 permits an Authorised Firm to offer or provide such a service or facility only if the lending is for use in the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism i.e. the process that involves committing Crypto Tokens to support a blockchain network and confirm transactions. In addition, such a service or facility may be offered or provided only to Professional Clients or Market Counterparties, and where the Authorised Firm meets the additional requirements in Rule 15.6.5(3).
