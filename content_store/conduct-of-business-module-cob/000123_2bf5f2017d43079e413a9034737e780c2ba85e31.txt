Overall suitability for the Client’s portfolio

2. When recommending a financial product to a Client, or executing a discretionary transaction

for a Client, an Authorised Firm should consider the overall effect the recommendation or discretionary transaction would have on the Client’s investment portfolio. For example, for a Client with a low or medium risk profile, a proportion of high-risk financial products in the Client’s portfolio may be suitable, provided this is consistent with the risk-return profile of the portfolio, and the firm is satisfied that any financial products that are recommended to the Client, or invested in, on behalf of the Client, are likely to meet the Client’s investment objectives and financial circumstances.
