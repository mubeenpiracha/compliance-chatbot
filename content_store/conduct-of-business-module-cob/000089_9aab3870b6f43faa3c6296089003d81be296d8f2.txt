CONDUCT OF BUSINESS (COB)

Reliance on a classification made elsewhere

(1) This Rule applies to an Authorised Firm which is a Branch or is a member of a

Group.

(2) An Authorised Firm may, subject to (3), rely on a client classification made, if it is a Branch, by its head office or any other branch of the same legal entity, or if it is a member of a Group, by any other member of its Group, if it has reasonable grounds to believe that such a client classification is substantially similar to the client classification required under this chapter.

(3)

If any gaps are identified between the requirements applicable to the Authorised Firm under this chapter and the requirements under which the client classification is carried out by another entity referred to in (2), the Authorised Firm may only rely on such a client classification if it has effectively addressed the identified gaps.
