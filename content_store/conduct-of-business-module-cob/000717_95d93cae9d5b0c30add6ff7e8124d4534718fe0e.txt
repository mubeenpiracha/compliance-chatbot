Rule A7.3.2 prohibits an Authorised Firm from paying any interest or other return on Stored Value. This prohibition is intended to remove the likelihood or perception that the funds are held as deposits. However, the Rule does not prevent the Authorised Firm from offering incentives that encourage the use of stored value, such as reward points or merchant discounts.
