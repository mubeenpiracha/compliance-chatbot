Guidance

1. An Operator in providing the information under Rule 12.3.1 must not offer investment selection assistance tools to Members, as such tools may be construed as Advising on Financial Products. However, if such a tool is offered by an investment manager of an investment option, the Operator may let Members know how the tool may be accessed and the investment manager responsible for the tool.

2. A human resources department may provide information and conduct information sessions for Members and prospective Members about the Employee Money Purchase Scheme to which contributions will be made in respect of the Members. However, a human resource department should not give advice to Members on matters such as selecting investment options, or the merits of making voluntary contributions. Such advice should be given by a firm authorised to give advice on financial products.
