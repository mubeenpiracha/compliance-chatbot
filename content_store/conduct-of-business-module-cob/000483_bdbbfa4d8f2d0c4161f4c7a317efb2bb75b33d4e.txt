11.6.1 This section applies to a Property Investment Crowdfunding Operator.

Property characteristics

11.6.2 The operator must ensure that each property listed for sale on its platform satisfies

both of the following conditions:

(a) the property consists of an individual apartment, house or building with a single

discrete title deed; and

(b) the property may be used only for residential purposes.

Guidance

Property Investment Crowdfunding permits investors to invest in one or more Special Purpose Vehicles that each hold a single property. The operator should not facilitate investments in a pool of properties held in a single Special Purpose Vehicle; as such a pooling arrangement is likely to constitute a Collective Investment Fund. GEN Rule 2.2.10E prohibits an operator from operating such a Fund.
