Guidance

1.

The Financial Service of Operating a Credit Rating Agency is defined in GEN Rule 2.27.1. This chapter contains the specific conduct requirements that apply to Persons carrying on the Financial Service of Operating a Credit Rating Agency.

Code of conduct/ethics

2.

The outcome intended by some of the specific conduct requirements in this chapter can be achieved by adopting a code of conduct/ethics. Whilst not proposing to prescribe that a Credit Rating Agency must have a code of conduct/ethics, a Credit Rating Agency should consider, particularly where noted in relation to specific Rules, adopting such a code as a means of achieving the outcome intended by the relevant requirements. However, where a Credit Rating Agency does not adopt such a code, the onus is on the Credit Rating Agency to demonstrate how it achieves compliance with the relevant requirements through other means.
