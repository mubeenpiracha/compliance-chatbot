Proposals not to be advertised outside platform

(1) An operator must:

(a)

not advertise a specific lending or Investment proposal that is available on its platform; and

(b)

take reasonable steps to ensure that borrowers, Issuers and sellers that use its platform do not advertise the lending or Investment proposal,

unless the advertisement is made on the platform and is accessible only to existing Clients who use the platform.

(2) An operator does not contravene the prohibition in (1)(a) by advertising a proposal outside the platform (in a way that is accessible to Persons who are not existing Clients) if the advertisement contains only the following information about the proposal:

(a)

in the case of Property Investment Crowdfunding either or both of the following:

(i)

the local area of a property being sold on that platform;

(ii)

the sale price of the property; and

(b)

in the case of Loan Crowdfunding or Investment Crowdfunding Platform (as applicable), all or any of the following:

(i)

the industry or profession of the borrower or Issuer (as applicable) who wishes to obtain funding;

(ii)

the purpose of the funding;

(iii)

the total amount of funding being sought.

Guidance

Rule 11.3.8 does not prevent users of a platform who are seeking funding from referring other Persons to the operator or providing a link to the operator’s website homepage.

CONDUCT OF BUSINESS (COB)

2.

If an Investment proposal is advertised to Persons who are not Clients of the operator, in addition to breaching Rule 11.3.8, this may constitute an Offer of Securities to the Public that requires a Prospectus, as the offer may no longer meet the conditions of the Exempt Offer exclusion for Crowdfunding Platforms in MKT Rule 2.3.1(m).

3.

In the DFSA’s view, an advertisement containing only the limited information specified in Rule 11.3.8(2) about a proposal would not by itself constitute an Offer of Securities to the Public that requires a Prospectus.

4.

Rule 11.3.8 does not prevent an operator from generally promoting its crowdfunding service to potential Clients, provided it does not advertise a specific proposal.

the value of, or return on, an Investment in the case of Property Investment Crowdfunding.
