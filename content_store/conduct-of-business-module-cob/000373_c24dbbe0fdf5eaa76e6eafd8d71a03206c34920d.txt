Guidance

An ATS Operator, when assessing the suitability of a Price Information Provider (the provider), should take into account factors such as:

a.

the providerâ€™s standing and reliability in the relevant physical or derivatives markets as a credible price reporting agency;

b.

the quality of corporate governance adopted, covering areas such as independent members of the board, independence of its internal audit and risk management function;

c.

whether the methodologies and processes (including any material changes to such methodologies and processes) adopted by the provider for the purposes of pricing are made publicly available;
