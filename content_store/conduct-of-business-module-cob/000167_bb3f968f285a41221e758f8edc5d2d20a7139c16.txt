Guidance

An Authorised Firm may consider including a price chart or line graph depicting the performance of the Investment or Crypto Token for the period that the Authorised Firm has assigned a rating or recommendation for that investment, including the dates on which the ratings were revised for the purposes of the requirements such as in (d) and (e) of Rule 6.3.3.

For the purposes of this section, an Authorised Firm must take reasonable steps to ensure that when it publishes Investment Research, and in the case where a representative of the Authorised Firm makes a Public Appearance, disclosure is made of the following matters:

(a)

any financial interest or material interest that the Investment Analyst or a Close Relative of the analyst has, which relates to the Investment or Crypto Token;

(b)

the reporting lines for Investment Analysts and their remuneration arrangements where such matters give rise to any conflicts of interest which may reasonably be likely to impair the impartiality of the Investment Research;
