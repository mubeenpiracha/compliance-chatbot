Guidance

1.

The prohibition in Rule 15.6.4 applies to any Authorised Firm that carries on a Financial Service relating to a Crypto Token or Crypto Token Derivative including, for example, an Authorised Firm that advises on, arranges, or executes transactions relating to Crypto Tokens or Crypto Token Derivatives or Operates a MTF. An Authorised Firm’s systems and controls need to have measures to prevent not only the Authorised Firm, but also any person acting for or on behalf of the Authorised Firm, from offering or providing incentives (see also Rule 3.5.3(1)).

2.

Offering incentives is also likely to conflict with the Authorised Firm’s overarching duty to act in the best interest of the Retail Client (see also GEN Rules 4.2.1 and 4.2.7).

3.

Incentives include bonus offers, gifts, rebates of fees (including volume-based rebates), trading credits or any form of reward in relation to the opening of a new account or trading in a new type of Crypto Token or Crypto Token Derivative offered to an existing or potential new Retail Client.
