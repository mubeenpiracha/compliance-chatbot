1. When a Person becomes a Client of an Authorised Firm is a question of fact that needs to be addressed by the firm in light of the nature of the relevant Financial Service (or financial product) involved, and the relations and interactions which the firm has with that Person. For instance, in certain types of Financial Services (such as corporate advisory services), a number of conversations (such as marketing and promotional activities) may occur between an Authorised Firm and a potential client before it may appear to the firm on a reasonable basis that the Person is likely to obtain a Financial Service from the firm, at which point a client classification is required. Given the many different circumstances in which interactions between a potential client and an Authorised Firm take place, it is not possible to include a more specific requirement than the current provision which requires the client classification to occur “before” a firm provides a Financial Service to a Person – see Rule 2.3.1(1). This provides an Authorised Firm flexibility to determine when exactly it would be appropriate for the firm to undertake client classification.
