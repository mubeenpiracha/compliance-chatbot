Guidance

1.

To make an informed decision about whether to buy or sell a Crypto Token traded on a MTF, users of the MTF need accurate and up-to-date information about matters that may affect the price of the Crypto Token. As there is no Reporting Entity for a Crypto Token, the MTF Operator is responsible for ensuring that adequate ongoing information about the Crypto Token is made available.

2.

Ongoing information may be published by the MTF Operator on its website, or the MTF Operator may provide links on its website to the site where the information can be found. If the MTF Operator provides links to the information, the links should take a user directly to the relevant information and the site should contain reliable information.

3.

Under Rule 15.3.2(2)(e) and (3), an MTF Operator is required to disclose that a person has a significant holding even if it not reasonably able to establish their identity.
