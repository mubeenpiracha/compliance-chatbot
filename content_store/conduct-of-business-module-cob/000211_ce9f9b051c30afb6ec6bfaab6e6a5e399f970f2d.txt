Guidance

The DFSA expects an Authorised Firm to maintain proper books and accounts based on the double- entry booking principle. They should be legible, up to date and contain narratives with the entries which identify and provide adequate information about each transaction. Entries should be made in chronological order and the current balance should be shown on each of the Authorised Firmâ€™s ledgers.
