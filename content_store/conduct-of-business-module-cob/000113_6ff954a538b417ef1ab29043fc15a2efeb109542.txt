 to enable the safe storage and transmission of data relating to the Investment Tokens;

Guidance

Where an Authorised Firm that is a Digital Wallet Service Provider delegates any function to a Third Party Digital Wallet Service Provider, it must ensure that the delegate fully complies with the requirements of Rule 14.3.3. The outsourcing and delegation requirements of GEN Rule 5.3.21 and 5.3.22 will also apply to the Authorised Firm in those circumstances.

14.3.4 An ATS Operator that appoints a Third Party Digital Wallet Service Provider to Provide Custody of Investment Tokens traded on its facility, must ensure that the person is either:

(a)

an Authorised Firm appropriately authorised to be a Digital Wallet Service Provider; or

(b)

an entity that is regulated by a Financial Services Regulator to an equivalent level of regulation to that provided for under the DFSA regime for Providing Digital Wallet Services.

Guidance

Where an ATS Operator appoints a non-DIFC firm regulated by a Financial Services Regulator, it must undertake sufficient due diligence to establish that the non-DIFC firm is subject to an equivalent level of regulation as under the DFSA regime in respect of that service.

14.3.5 A Digital Wallet Service Provider must ensure that the report required under Rule 14.5.1 includes confirmation as to whether it has complied with the requirements in Rule 14.3.3.
