Guidance

1.

The prohibition in Rule 8.5.2(1) includes, for example, making proposals or recommendations regarding the design or structure of Rating Subjects, including suggestions as to how a desired rating could be achieved. Therefore, such services cannot be provided.

2.

Some of the activities which are prohibited under Rule 8.5.2(1) may constitute a Financial Service other than Operating a Credit Rating Agency. Even if a Credit Rating Agency has an authorisation to provide such a Financial Service, it is prevented from providing such services to a Rating Subject or a Related Party because of the prohibition in Rule 8.5.2(1).

3.

Ancillary services referred to in Rule 8.5.2(3) include, for example, market forecasts, estimates of economic trends, pricing analysis and other general data analysis as well as related distribution services. These services can be provided to Rating Subjects and their Related Parties where the requirements in Rule 8.5.2(3) are met. These services are also unlikely to constitute other Financial Services.
