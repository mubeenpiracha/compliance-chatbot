Crypto Token Derivatives (i.e. Derivatives relating to Crypto Tokens) are Investments. An Authorised Firm trading a Crypto Token Derivative is therefore required to comply with requirements such as ensuring the Derivative contracts meet the contract design specifications in AMI Rule 6.3.2 and, if the value of the Derivative is determined by reference to a benchmark or index, ensuring the Price Information Provider meets the requirements in Rule 9.4.2. In addition, under Rule 9.4.1 and GEN section 3A, any underlying Crypto Token to which the Derivative relates is required to be a Recognised Crypto Token and, if the Derivative relates to an index, the index may contain only Recognised Crypto Tokens.
