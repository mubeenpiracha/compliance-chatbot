Retail Clients

4.

A Person who cannot be classified as a Professional Client or Market Counterparty in accordance with the Rules is required to be classified as a Retail Client (see Rule 2.3.2). If an Authorised Firm chooses to provide Financial Services to a Person as a Retail Client, it may do so by simply classifying that Person as a Retail Client without having to follow any further procedures as required for classifying Persons as Professional Clients or Market Counterparties.
