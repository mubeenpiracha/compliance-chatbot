Guidance

1.

The activity described in GEN Rule 2.26.1 is marketing of financial services and financial products which are offered in a jurisdiction outside the DIFC. Such marketing activities can be conducted by an Authorised Firm, which holds a Representative Office Licence, provided the financial services or financial products marketed by it are those offered by its head office or a member of its Group.

2.

As a Representative Office conducting marketing activities of the kind described in GEN Rule 2.26.1 does not have a client relationship with a Person to whom it markets a financial service or financial product, the client classification requirements in this chapter do not apply to the firm with regard to that Person.

3.

Other Authorised Firms can also conduct marketing activities, of the kind described in GEN Rule 2.26.1, under the exclusion in GEN Rule 2.26.2.
