(f)

includes a distribution of the different ratings or recommendations, in percentage terms:

(i)

for all Investments or Crypto Tokens;

(ii)

for Investments in each sector covered; and

(iii)

for Investments or Crypto Tokens, if any, where the Authorised Firm has undertaken corporate finance business with or for the Issuer over the past 12 months; and

(g)

if intended for use only by a Professional Client or Market Counterparty, contains a clear warning that it should not be relied upon by or distributed to Retail Clients.

Guidance

An Authorised Firm may consider including a price chart or line graph depicting the performance of the Investment or Crypto Token for the period that the Authorised Firm has assigned a rating or recommendation for that investment, including the dates on which the ratings were revised for the purposes of the requirements such as in (d) and (e) of Rule 6.3.3.

For the purposes of this section, an Authorised Firm must take reasonable steps to ensure that when it publishes Investment Research, and in the case where a representative of the Authorised Firm makes a Public Appearance, disclosure is made of the following matters:

(a)

any financial interest or material interest that the Investment Analyst or a Close Relative of the analyst has, which relates to the Investment or Crypto Token;

(b)

the reporting lines for Investment Analysts and their remuneration arrangements where such matters give rise to any conflicts of interest which may reasonably be likely to impair the impartiality of the Investment Research;

(c)

any shareholding by the Authorised Firm or its Associate of 1% or more of the total issued share capital of the Issuer;

(ca)

in the case of a Crypto Token, any holding of 1% or more of the total number of issued Crypto Tokens of that type;

(d)

if the Authorised Firm or its Associate acts as corporate broker for the Issuer;

(e)

any material shareholding by the Issuer in the Authorised Firm;

(f)

any corporate finance business undertaken by the Authorised Firm with or for the Issuer over the past 12 months, and any future relevant corporate finance business initiatives; and

(g)

that the Authorised Firm is a Market Maker in the Investment or Crypto Token, if that is the case.

6.3.6

CONDUCT OF BUSINESS (COB)

Guidance

The requirements in Rule 6.3.4(a) and (b) apply to an Authorised Firm in addition to other requirements in the DFSA Rulebook. For example, an Authorised Firm is required to take reasonable steps to identify actual or potential conflicts of interest and then prevent or manage them under GEN Rule 4.2.7 (Principle 7 – Conflicts of Interest). Further, COB Rule 6.3.2 requires an Authorised Firm to have adequate procedures and controls when it prepares or publishes Investment Research.

Restrictions on publication

If an Authorised Firm acts as a manager or co-manager of an initial public offering or a secondary offering, it must take reasonable steps to ensure that:

(a)

it does not publish Investment Research relating to the Investment during a Quiet Period; and

(b)

an Investment Analyst from the Authorised Firm does not make a Public Appearance relating to that Investment during a Quiet Period.

Guidance

The DFSA does not consider the same conflicts of interest mentioned in this section arise if an Investment Analyst prepares Investment Research solely for an Authorised Firm’s own use and not for publication. For example, if the research material is prepared solely for the purposes of the Authorised Firm’s proprietary trading then the use of this information would fall outside the restrictions placed on publications.

Restriction on own account transactions

(1) Unless (2) applies, an Authorised Firm or its Associate must not knowingly execute an Own Account Transaction in an Investment, Crypto Token or related Investment, which is the subject of Investment Research, prepared either by the Authorised Firm or its Associate, until the
