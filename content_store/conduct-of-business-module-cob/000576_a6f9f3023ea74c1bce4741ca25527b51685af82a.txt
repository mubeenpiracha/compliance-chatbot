Ongoing Information

15.3.2 (1)

An MTF Operator must take reasonable steps to ensure that accurate and up- to-date information is made available about Crypto Tokens traded on the MTF so that users of the MTF are able to make informed decisions about trading in the Crypto Tokens.

(2) Without limiting the generality of (1), the MTF Operator must as a minimum

ensure the following information is readily available for each Crypto Token:

(a)

the total number, and market capitalisation, of the Crypto Tokens traded globally;

(b)

whether the supply of the Crypto Tokens is set to increase or decrease according to a pre-defined path;

(c)

details of any inflationary or deflationary mechanisms that are to be used, such as the issuing or burning of the Crypto Tokens (other than through the normal mining process);

(d)

the total number of the Crypto Tokens held by the developers or issuer of the Crypto Token, held in reserve for rewards or other promotional purposes or otherwise locked away from the total supply of the Crypto Tokens;
