Guidance

An Authorised Firm should undertake a thorough assessment of the nature of the goods and services and the terms upon which they are to be provided under a Soft Dollar Agreement to ensure that the receipt of such goods and services provide commensurate value. This is particularly the case if any costs of such goods and services are to be passed through to Clients. Where the Client bears the cost of the goods and services, the disclosure obligation relating to costs and charges under Rule 3.3.2 (see App 2) will apply to such costs.

An Authorised Firm must not Deal in Investments as Agent for a Client, either directly or indirectly, through any broker under a Soft Dollar Agreement, unless:

(a)

the agreement is a written agreement for the supply of goods or services described in Rule 3.5.4, which do not take the form of, or include, cash or any other direct financial benefit;

(b)

Transaction execution by the broker is consistent with any best execution obligations owed to the Client;
