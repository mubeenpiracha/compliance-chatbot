Professional Clients

5.

There are three routes through which a Person may be classified as a Professional Client:

a.

‘deemed’ Professional Clients under Rule 2.3.4. As these Persons have significant assets under their control, and, therefore, either possess, or have the resources to obtain, the necessary expertise to manage such assets, they can be classified as ‘deemed’ Professional Clients without having to meet any additional net asset and expertise criteria;

b.

‘service-based’ Professional Clients under Rule 2.3.5, Rule 2.3.6 or Rule 2.3.6A. Due to their inherent nature, certain Financial Services activities such as credit provided to an Undertaking for business purposes (‘commercial credit’), advisory and arranging activities relating to corporate structuring and financing and crowdfunding services provided to a Body Corporate that is a borrower or an Issuer, are generally provided to Persons with sufficient expertise to obtain such services or are of relatively low risk to the Client. Therefore, a Person to whom such a Financial Service is provided can be classified as a ‘service-based’ Professional Client; and
