are sufficiently flexible in the design to address varying scenarios;

c.

establish a predictable and timely process for dealing with Error Trades, including measures specifically designed to detect and identify Error Trade messages to market users;

d.

promote transparency to market users with regard to any cancellation decisions involving material transactions resulting from the invocation of the Error Trade policy;

e.

include adequate surveillance conducted in the markets to detect Error Trades;

f.

promote predictability, fairness and consistency of actions taken under the Error Trade policy; and
