Guidance

1.

The effect of the above Rule is to prevent a Retail Client from incurring losses exceeding the funds the Retail Client has specifically dedicated to trading in Restricted Speculative Investments. As a result, an Authorised Firm that has opened a trading account for a Retail Client to trade in Restricted Speculative Investments will not be able to recover any losses from the Retail Client that go beyond the funds in the Retail Client’s trading account.

2.

Funds in the Retail Client’s trading account are generally cash in the account, and include unrealised net profits from open positions (i.e. the sum of unrealised gains and losses of all open positions recorded in the Retail Client’s account) in respect of all Restricted Speculative Investments held in the Retail Client’s trading account.

Offer of incentives prohibited

6.16.9 (1) An Authorised Firm must not offer or provide to a Retail Client any incentive that influences, or is reasonably likely to influence, the Retail Client to trade in a Restricted Speculative Investment.
