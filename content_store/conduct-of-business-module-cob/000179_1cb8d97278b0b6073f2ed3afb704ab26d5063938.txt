Guidance

1.

A non-market price Transaction is a Transaction where the dealing rate or price paid by the Authorised Firm or its Client differs from the prevailing market rate or price to a material extent or the Authorised Firm or its Client gives materially more or less in value than it receives in return.

2.

In general, Authorised Firms should undertake transactions at the prevailing market price. Failure to do this may result in an Authorised Firm participating, whether deliberately or unknowingly, in the concealment of a profit or loss, or in the perpetration of a fraud.
