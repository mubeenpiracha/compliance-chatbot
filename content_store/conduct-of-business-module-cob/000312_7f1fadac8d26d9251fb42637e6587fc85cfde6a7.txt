Guidance

1.

See GEN Rules 5.3.18 and 5.3.19 with regard to the assessment that a Credit Rating Agency, as an Authorised Firm, needs to undertake to ensure that its Employees (including Rating Analysts) are fit and proper and have adequate competencies in order to carry out their functions.

2.

A Credit Rating Agency should structure its rating teams in such a way so as to promote continuity of adequate skills and expertise within a relevant team, and avoidance of bias in the preparation or review of a Credit Rating. For the purpose of promoting objectivity and lack of bias in preparing or reviewing Credit Ratings, measures such as periodic rotation of Rating Analysts, as appropriate, should be considered.
