Fairly and in due turn

An Authorised Firm must deal with Own Account Transactions and Client Transactions fairly and in due turn.

Averaging of prices

(1)

An Authorised Firm may execute a series of Transactions on behalf of a Client within the same trading day or within such other period as may be agreed in writing by the Client, to achieve one investment decision or objective, or to meet Transactions which it has aggregated.

(2)

If the Authorised Firm does so, it may determine a uniform price for the Transactions executed during the period, calculated as the weighted average of the various prices of the Transactions in the series.
