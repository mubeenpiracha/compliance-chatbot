Private and public keys, which correspond to an electronic address, provide the mechanism to own and control Investment Tokens, (and other crypto assets). A private key is generated first, with the public key derived from the private key using a known one-way algorithm which varies across protocols. The corresponding electronic address, which is used to send and receive crypto assets, is a cryptographic hash (i.e. a shorter representation created through a processing algorithm) of the public key (which is a longer string of characters). It is the private key that grants the user the right to dispose of the crypto asset at a given address. Losing the private key often results in the loss of ability to transfer the crypto asset.
