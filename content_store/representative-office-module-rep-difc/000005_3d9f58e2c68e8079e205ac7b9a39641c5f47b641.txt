Guidance

1.

Because of the limited nature of the Financial Service of Operating a Representative Office much of the DFSA Rulebook has been disapplied for Representative Offices. While most of the key provisions applying to a Representative Office are contained in this module, a Representative Office should ensure that it complies with and has regard to other relevant provisions in other applicable DFSA Rulebook Modules including AML, GEN chapters 1 to 3 and 11 and sections 6.9 and 6.10, CIR chapter 2 and sections 3.5 to 3.7 and FER. The application section of each Rulebook module sets out which chapters, if any, apply to a Representative Office.

2.

A Representative Office should also ensure that it complies with and has regard to relevant provisions of the Regulatory Law and Markets Law. The Regulatory Law gives the DFSA a number of important powers in relation to Authorised Firms including powers of supervision and enforcement.
