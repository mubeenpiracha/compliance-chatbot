REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE (REP)

3.

In addition to the above, a Rep Office may undertake certain additional activities which may not necessarily amount to ‘marketing’ of related party financial services and financial products. Examples are activities to increase the profile of its head office and be the point of contact and source of information about those parties. Similarly, a Rep Office may also report to the head office on matters such as business trends, business opportunities and developments in the DIFC markets.
