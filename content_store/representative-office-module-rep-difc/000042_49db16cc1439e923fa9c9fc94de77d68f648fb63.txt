Guidance

While a Representative Office is prohibited from holding money or other assets belonging to its customers, it is not prevented from being able to hold ‘money or other property’ belonging to a ‘related party’ (i.e. its head office, another branch of the head office or a Group member) to deal with its ordinary expenses.

4.4 Solvency

4.4.1 A Representative Office must notify the DFSA immediately upon becoming aware that it is unlikely to remain solvent in the near future or that it is insolvent.
