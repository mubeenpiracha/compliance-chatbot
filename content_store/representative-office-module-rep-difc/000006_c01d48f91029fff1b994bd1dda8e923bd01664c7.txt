GEN Rule 2.26.1 defines the Financial Service of Operating a Representative Office and prescribes the activities which a Representative Office is permitted to carry on. By virtue of GEN 2.2.9 and 2.26.2, the Financial Service of Operating a Representative Office is a stand alone financial service activity.

Whilst much Representative Office activity will not involve a continuing relationship with the Persons to whom marketing is directed, where such a relationship is necessary, the Representative Office will need to be careful to ensure that it does not carry on any activities other than those prescribed under GEN Rule 2.26.1.

A Representative Office which undertakes a Financial Service which is outside the scope of its Licence will be in breach of Article 42(4) of the Regulatory Law. If the DFSA believes that a Representative Office is in breach of Article 42(4), it may take steps which may include withdrawal of authorisation and formal enforcement action under the Regulatory Law.
