the DIFC a Financial Service other

Guidance

The Law Regulating Islamic Financial Business 2004, contains a prohibition against an Authorised Firm holding itself out as conducting Islamic Financial Business without first obtaining an endorsement to its Licence. An Islamic Financial Institution may operate a Representative Office in the DIFC but it is deemed not to be conducting Islamic Financial Business through its Representative Office. This is because of the limited nature of the financial services activity it is permitted to carry on and because it does not enter into client relationships in the DIFC. Accordingly, there is no requirement to obtain an appropriate endorsement to its Licence and the IFR module does not apply.
