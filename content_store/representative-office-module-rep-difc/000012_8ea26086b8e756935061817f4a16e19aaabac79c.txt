6. A Rep Office must take particular care to ensure that it acts within the scope of its Licence, given the far narrower activities it can undertake by way of giving information about financial services and financial products, compared to a firm licensed to ‘Advise on Financial Products’, as highlighted below.

This is advice, not just giving general information.
