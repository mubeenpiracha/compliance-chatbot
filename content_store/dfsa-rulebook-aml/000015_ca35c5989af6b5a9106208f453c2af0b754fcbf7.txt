Guidance on the customer risk assessment

1.

The risk assessment of a customer, which is illustrated in figure 3 above, requires a Relevant Person to allocate an appropriate risk rating to every customer. The DFSA would expect risk ratings to be either descriptive, such as “low”, “medium” or “high”, or a sliding numeric scale such as 1 for the lowest risk to 10 for the highest. Depending on the outcome of a Relevant Person’s assessment of its customer’s money laundering risk, a Relevant Person should decide to what degree CDD will need to be performed. For a high risk customer, the Relevant Person will need to undertake Enhanced CDD under section 7.4 as well as the normal CDD set out in section 7.3. For a low risk customer, the Relevant Person may be able to undertake Simplified CDD in accordance with section 7.5.
