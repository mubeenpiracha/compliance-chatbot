Guidance

1.

Unless a Relevant Person understands the money laundering risks to which it is exposed, it cannot take appropriate steps to prevent its business being used for the purposes of money laundering. Money laundering risks vary from business to business depending on the nature of the business, the type of customers a business has, and the nature of the products and services sold.

2.

Using the RBA, a Relevant Person should assess its own vulnerabilities to money laundering and take all reasonable steps to eliminate or manage such risks. The results of this assessment will also feed into the Relevant Personâ€™s risk assessment of its customers under chapter 6.

3.

Under Article 4 of Cabinet Decision No.10 of 2019, in assessing its money laundering risks and taking steps to mitigate those risks, a Relevant Person is required to take into consideration the results of the National Risk Assessment prepared by the National Anti- Money Laundering and Combating Financing of Terrorism Committee (NAMLCFTC).
