For the purposes of Article 38(1)(a) and (b):

(a)

in the case of a Fund where the Units are or have been included in an Official List of Securities (a “Listed Fund”):

(i)

a reference to a Reporting Entity is a reference to the Fund Manager of that Fund or such other person as the DFSA may declare (who may also be called a “Reporting Entity of the Listed Fund”); and

(ii)

any obligations of a Reporting Entity are, unless the context requires otherwise, obligations in respect of the Listed Fund; and

(b)

for avoidance of doubt, a person does not become a Reporting Entity of a Listed Fund by merely offering the Units of the Fund to the public, unless the Units are also admitted to an Authorised Market Institution.

(c)

in the case of a Fund, other than a Listed Fund, where the Units are Security Tokens admitted to trading on an Alternative Trading System:

(i)

a reference to a Reporting Entity is a reference to the Fund Manager of that Fund or such other person as the DFSA may declare; and
